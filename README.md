## Folders

- **`data`**: data files created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file and contains cached as well as final data files. The data folder can be downloaded from [10.5281/zenodo.11352062](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11352062)
  - `gdm`: Folder containing data for Maps
  - `cluster.rds`: Cluster data, including keypaper, snowball, etc
  - `snowball.rds`: Snowball data of the general snowball
- **`figures`**: figures created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file in low-res as well as high-res.
  - `approaches_theories_*.*`: Sankeys of Theories -> Approaches in different formats and level 1, level two and both
  - `cluster_*.*`: Cluster citation networks  any are missing because they could not be plotted (to many nodes and edges)
  - `common_l3.*`: Common papers in Approaches between the snowball searches. the html is ionteractive.
  - `snowball_cited_*.*`: Snowball citation networks of the general snowball search
- **`maps`**: Maps created during the running of the `IPBES_TCA_Ch3_clusters.qmd` file
  - author distributions by country by first author and all authors for each Approach (cluster)
- **`input`**: input files for the `IPBES_TCA_Ch3_clusters.qmd` file
  - `key_papers`: folder containing the key papers for the Approach / cluster based snowball searches
  - `keypapers.csv` file with the key papers for the general snowball search
  - `T&F of TC from CA - chapter 3 - All theories from CA coded.csv` containing raw data for Approach based snowball searches as well as relationship between Theories and Approaches
