We suggest there is a need for collaborative environments where experimentation with new configurations of social–ecological systems can occur, and we refer to these as transformative spaces. In this paper, we seek a better understanding of how to design and enable the creation of transformative spaces in a development context. We analyse nine case studies from a previous special issue on Designing Transformative Spaces that aimed to collect examples of cutting-edge action-oriented research on transformations from the Global South. The analysis showed five design phases as being essential: Problem Definition Phase; Operationalisation Phase; Tactical Phase; Outcome Phase; and Reflection Phase. From this synthesis, we distilled five key messages that should be considered when designing research, including: (a) there are ethical dilemmas associated with creating a transformative space in a system; (b) it is important to assess the readiness of the system for change before engaging in it; (c) there is a need to balance between ‘safe’ and ‘safe-enough’ spaces for transformation; (d) convening a transformative space requires an assemblage of diverse methodological frameworks and tools; and (e) transformative spaces can act as a starting point for institutionalising transformative change. Many researchers are now engaging in transdisciplinary transformations research, and are finding themselves at the knowledge–action interface contributing to transformative space-making. We hope that by analysing experiences from across different geographies we can contribute towards better understanding of how to navigate the processes needed for the urgent global transformations that are being called for to create a more equitable and sustainable planet Earth.","2020-01","2024-02-27 09:06:55","2024-02-27 09:06:55","2024-02-27 09:06:55","161-178","","1","15","","Sustain Sci","Transformative spaces in the making","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TCA_Ch3_cluster/storage/3ANTIS9J/Pereira et al_2020_Transformative spaces in the making.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The overall scope of the values assessment is to assess multiple sources and traditions of knowledge regarding diverse values of nature, including the strengths and weaknesses associated with existing valuation methods and approaches to make such values visible. The assessment provides conceptual and practical tools to aid policymakers in the recognition and accounting of nature’s values in different decision-making contexts. The values assessment provides guidelines, criteria, tools and a road map to navigate the ways in which values play out in decisions, as well as the role values and valuation can have in achieving more sustainable pathways. It should be noted that the assessment does not provide quantifications (e.g., in monetary or other indicators) of the diverse values of nature across the globe as its emphasis is on methodologies. The assessment report is composed of the summary for policymakers together with the six chapters and some front and back matters, which will be added following the ninth session of the Plenary.","2022-04-26","2024-02-27 09:07:40","2024-02-27 09:07:40","2024-02-27 09:07:40","","","","","","","","","","","","Zenodo","","en","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, Open Access","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","DOI: 10.5281/ZENODO.6522522","","","","","Assessment; Diverse; IPBES; Methodological; Valuation; Values","","","","Balvanera, Patricia; Pascual, Unai; Christie, Michael; González-Jiménez, David","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
