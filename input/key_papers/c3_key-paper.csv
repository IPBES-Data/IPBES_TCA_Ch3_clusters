This represents a unique and crucial opportunity to integrate and accelerate food system actions to tackle interconnected global challenges. In this context, agroecology is a game-changing approach that can provide the world’s growing population with nutritious, healthy affordable food, ensure fair incomes to farmers and halt and reverse the degradation of the natural environment. Here, we explore agroecological transition pathways in four case studies from low- and middle- income countries and identify catalysts for change. We find that enabling policy and market environments, participatory action research and local socio-technical support each plays a critical role in stimulating transitions towards agroecology. We propose strategies and priorities for research to better support agroecological transitions using these catalysts of change as entry points. Engagement of governments, private sector, civil society, farmers and farm workers in this research agenda is essential.","2022-11","2024-02-27 08:58:13","2024-02-27 08:58:13","2024-02-27 08:58:13","2557-2577","","6","17","","Sustain Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TCA_Ch3_cluster/storage/U554GZVL/Jones et al_2022_Research strategies to catalyze agroecological transitions in low- and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deliberately engaging in transformation processes inevitably requires imagination. We refer to imagination for transformations as interdependent cognitive and social processes that create representations of present and possible future states of the world that can inform public deliberation, policy, decision making, and behavior from the individual to the global scale. We contend that imagination is an essential capacity for securing ecological, social, economic, and cultural well-being in times of rapid and often unpredictable global change. We sketch an emerging interdisciplinary research agenda on imagination as a transformational capacity and its role in transformation processes, building on contributions to a special issue on this subject. We specifically focus on imagination in relationship to transformative agency, causation, and individual-collective dynamics. Our aim is to identify research questions and challenges that are most pressing with a view to supporting efforts of transformations toward sustainability.","2020-12-22","2024-02-27 09:04:07","2024-02-27 09:04:07","2024-02-27 09:04:07","081","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero TCA_Ch3_cluster/storage/LU9MGSFH/Moore_Milkoreit_2020_Imagination and transformations to sustainable and just futures.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
