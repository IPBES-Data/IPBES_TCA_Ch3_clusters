1,01/10/2023 21:26:38,haas@polsci.umass.edu,Peter M. Haas,University of Massachusetts Amherst emeritus,Epistemic communities,"Epistemic Communities theory comes from international relations and focuses on the influence of scientists and experts on public policy and international cooperation. (Haas 1992, Haas 2015) While it has predominantly studied environmental issues, it extends to public health, particularly COVID, education and international political economy.
Epistemic communities are defined as groups of individuals who share common causal understandings, normative commitments, common truth tests, and are engaged in a collective policy project.
Under conditions of uncertainty and complexity decision makers are likely to defer to those with a reputation for authoritative expertise in the wake of a publicly recognized threat, often triggered by a crisis or disaster.  Epistemic communities, due to their substantive knowledge, are likely to provide better public policy advice which is capable of accurately recognizing the policy characteristics of an issue and able to provide policy advice which is likely to work,  unlike traditional political responses to crises, which tend to rely on business as usual approaches, or to apply public policies which are politically attractive.

Concretely, epistemic communities are associated with international regimes and treaties which are effective (Haas 2017). They are most likely to be influential when they satisfy a set of conditions:  they enjoy a reputation for impartial expertise, they confer “usable” knowledge which is politically salient, timely and useful at geographic and temporal scale; they are organized into standing science policy interface panels, they are able to set their own agendas, they are recruited on merit, and they enjoy distance from governments (Haas 2017). The IPCC, although it has produced authoritative science about climate change which keeps the issue on the international agenda, has not clearly impacted national decision making, in part because the governments control the Summary for Policy Makers and governments appoint the IPCC scientists (Haas 2004).

","Conservation regimes with epistemic community involvement stress ecological knowledge about ecosystems by protecting habitats rather than setting quotas or outright moratoria.  Salient examples of this include UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme,  the Polar Bears treaty ((Fikkan, Osherenko et al. 1993) and RAMSAR. Moreover they provide for the involvement of local people in the governance of the conservation regimes in which they reside.  
Epistemic communities may contribute to transformational governance (Haas 2021) . As biodiversity epistemic communities reflect the ecological perspective, their policy advice focuses on the governance of complex and coupled social and natural systems (Clark and Munn 1986, Holdgate 1999). In the conservation realm they contribute to the involvement of local actors in governance and value Indigenous knowledge. They are associated with more effective outcomes based on ecological realities. (Haas 2017) They also contribute to more comprehensive frames, where environmental conservation is linked to economic development and vice versa. For instance, environmental conservation becomes a guard rail for economic development, and economic instruments and concepts – such as the value of ecosystem services and the value of habitats are applied to the governance of biodiversity.  More generally they have contributed to an increasingly intertwined global political agenda including sustainability, trade and environment, environment and finance, environment and human rights, environment and security, and environment and development.

2,,,Theo Papaioannou,UK,Inclusive Innovation,"The last two decades have been characterised by recurrent economic and social crises. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected already fragile systems of employment around the world. In many countries worldwide, opportunities for decent work have declined, fair income and security in the workplace have been undermined, social protection for families and better prospects for personal development and social integration have been reduced. Meanwhile the Covid-19 crisis has also accelerated top-down technological innovations. These include apps and online platforms which enable new forms of communication, interactive learning and employment. But they also feature automated machine technologies, such as robots and artificial intelligence, which potentially worsen the precarious position of 1.8 billion low-skilled workers worldwide by putting their jobs at risk (World Bank, 2019 Gomez Solorzano, 2014). Some of these excluded workers and/or their low-income communities try to collectively respond to crises by innovating in inclusive ways and thereby initiating transformative change. 

Innovation is inclusive when the interests and the aspirations of low-income and marginalised communities are taken on board in processes of knowledge generation and exploitation for addressing basic needs. This theoretical agenda occupies the intellectual space between innovation, development and poverty alleviation studies (Pansera and Owen, 2018). It recognises that social exclusion and inequality have often resulted from disruptive technological innovations and production processes. These are generally top-down, expensive capital-intensive innovations which tend to exclude the interests and aspirations of lower-income and marginalised people. Crises such as Covid-19 exacerbate socio-economic exclusion and marginalisation for ‘bottom of the pyramid’ BOP communities. In order to provide more socially equitable, solidaristic alternatives, the concept of ‘inclusive innovation’ emphasises accessible novelty, namely: grassroots innovations and production processes which accommodate the needs of lower-income people, enhancing their capabilities and skills, improving their welfare and potentially empowering them (e.g., Arocena and Sutz, 2003; Prahalad, 2005; Cozzens, 2007; Srinivas and Sutz, 2008; Kaplinsky et al., 2009; Chataway et al, 2014; Levidow and Papaioannou, 2017; Papaioannou, 2018).","Arocena, R. and Sutz, J.

This empowers and transforms such communities, enabling them to take control of decisions about how to address their basic needs. Grassroots innovation processes respond to social injustices, socio-economic inequalities and environmental problems often arising from conventional capital-intensive innovation models (Smith et al., 2014). They develop social technologies i.e., readily reproducible techniques and methodologies which are co-created with communities to resolve their social inclusion problems (Chataway et al, 2010); these enhance both the innovative and human capabilities of lower income and marginalised people, improving their welfare and potentially transforming them (Levidow and Papaioannou, 2017; Papaioannou, 2018; Heeks et al, 2013). 
 
In those ways, ‘inclusive innovation’ encompasses various implicit models for explaining current social inclusion around technoscientific innovation, for identifying socio-economic inequities and for avoiding or remedying these outcomes. Each model involves normative assumptions about what transformative change ought to be, linked with diagnostic or prescriptive concepts. Inequity has been used as a prominent rationale for redesigning innovation to create greater value (for customers, shareholders and society) from fewer resources (natural resources, capital, time). The process becomes more equitable and transformative, providing viable alternatives and potentially disrupting conventional methods of production (Radjou and Prabhu, 2015: 11).

It emphasizes recognizing and addressing the diverse values associated with nature in order to drive meaningful change (IPBES 2019). The framework identifies four key 'values-centred leverage points' that work in synergy to catalyze transformative change. They range from short-term, easier to achieve actions (‘shallower leverage points’ namely undertaking valuation to recognize the values of nature; and embedding valuation in inclusive decision-making to meaningfully include the diverse values of nature in decision-making) to longer-term, harder to achieve efforts (‘deeper leverage points’ such as reforming policies, rights and regulations for institutions to embrace the diverse values of nature; and shifting societal norms and goals to mobilize sustainability-aligned values and shift developmental models; IPBES 2022). These leverage points are interdependent, whereby jointly activating them entails addressing feedbacks among them, adding them up (from shallow to deep) or cascading down (Pörtner et al. 2023). In summary, the framework emphasizes recognizing and integrating the diverse values of nature into decision-making processes, addressing institutional structures and societal norms, and acknowledges the need for power dynamics to shift. It offers a comprehensive approach to driving transformative change for the benefit of both nature and society.","Pascual, U. et al. (2023). Diverse values of nature for sustainability.

","Leverage Point 1: Highlights the need to recognize and account for the diverse values of nature through valuation methods. Such recognition is essential to mobilizing a broader set of specific values of nature and aligning them with sustainability-focused broad values. (IPBES 2022 Chapters 2, 4, 5)

Leverage Point 2: To drive change, information about these values generated through valuation methods must be integrated into inclusive decision-making processes. This may involve existing policy measures (like green taxes) or establishing planning guidelines that consider the many values of nature. (IPBES 2022 Chapters 4, 6; Zafra-Calvo et al. 2020)

Leverage Point 3: A deeper transformation necessitates a reconfiguration of societal structures. This includes reforms to core legal, economic, and political institutions, in ways that change what and whose values gain decision-making power in society. These changes aim to shift the power dynamics towards recognizing and incorporating diverse values in decisions (Vatn 2016).

Leverage Point 4: Transforming societal norms and goals is another vital aspect. This involves altering how society views 'progress' or a 'good life' in the context of relationships with nature (IPBES 2022 Chapter 5). These changes are inherently transformative and can be achieved through dialogues and participative fora (OECD 2020).

Transformative change is a multifaceted process involving engagement of the four values-centred leverage points. Fortunately, opportunities for synergies arise, as leverage points are not static; instead, there are interdependencies along the lever’s action gradient. Leverage points may be activated in a cumulative way (across the levers), such as when a policy change (e.g., introducing a green tax) triggers a change in social norms over time (e.g., recycling). Values-centred leverage points can also be triggered in the opposite direction (cascading down the levers). For example, the European Common Agricultural Policy shifting the role of agriculture (Hasler et al. 2022).

",Three Horizons,"Three Horizons is a framework and practice for exploring the future and change, from the established patterns of activity of the first horizon, to new patterns in the third, through transitional activities in the second (Curry and Hodgson, 2008; Sharpe et al., 2016).  
The central idea of Three Horizons is that it draws attention to the three horizons as existing always in the present moment and that there is evidence about the future in how people (including ourselves) are behaving now. The outcome of Three Horizons work is a map of transformational potential which enables a group to act with more skill, freedom and creativity in the present, both individually and together. 
The first horizon – H1 is the dominant system at present. It represents ‘business as usual’. We rely on these systems being stable and reliable. But as the world changes, so aspects of business as usual begin to feel out of place or no longer fit for purpose. Eventually business as usual will always be superseded by new patterns of activity. 
The third horizon – H3 emerges as the long-term successor to business as usual. It grows from fringe activity in the present that introduces completely new ways of doing things. 
The second horizon – H2 is a pattern of transition activities and innovations, people trying things out in response to the ways in which the landscape is changing. Some of these will be sustaining innovations and will be absorbed into the H1 systems to improve them and prolong their life, while some will be transformative and pave the way for the emergence of the radically different H3 systems.  ","Curry, A., Hodgson, A., 2008. Seeing in Multiple Horizons: Connecting Futures to Strategy. J. Futur. Stud. 13, 1–20. 
Sharpe, B., Hodgson, A., Leicester, G., Lyon, A., Fazey, I., 2016. Three horizons: a pathways practice for transformation. Ecol. Soc. 21. ","The Three Horizons framework has no commitment to any particular view of how transformational change occurs except that change is viewed systemically as a transition from the first to third horizon patterns of activity. It is intended for use by those who have some concern with an issue and agency with respect to bringing about the change they desire.  

The three horizons are understood not only as descriptive of patterns of activity but also as ‘voices,’ or three perspectives, on the future. The H1 voice is the voice of the manager. It talks about maintaining the current system and usually expresses concern. The H2 voice is the voice of the entrepreneur. It talks about trying something different and often expresses a combination of urgency and frustration. The H3 voice is the voice of the visionary. It talks about dreams and deep aspirations. These are typical ways in which each position ‘hears’ the other voices, as both positive and negative. Using Three Horizons effectively means becoming aware of all of these perspectives and working with them to shift the conversation in a generative direction 1.  

The model offers a simple way into a conversation about: 

•    the dominant system and the challenges to its sustainability into the future, i.e. the case for change (H1); 

•    the desirable future state, the ideal system desired and of which elements can be identified in the present that give encouragement and inspiration (H3); 

•    the nature of the tensions and dilemmas between H3 vision and H1 reality and the processes of change, new ways of working, new capacities, new structures, required to navigate the transition between them. 

 

Application of the framework provides five important insights about how transformation can be supported. First, it highlights that maintaining transformational intent in any change process is critical4. This may seem obvious, but most change reinforces a status quo and does not lead to something fundamentally new. Consequently, it is easy to lose sight of transformation.  

Second, most people struggle to envision a radically different third horizon. Considerable effort is thus needed to establish radically different, ambitious, visions. The concept of regenerative futures is useful here, with such systems having dynamics that ‘spiral up’ environmental and human benefit6. Using the regenerative concept helps push envisioning to include a fundamentally different set of underlying dynamics. This helps with issues like biodiversity loss, where new human-environment relationship are required6. 

Third, Three Horizons highlights the importance of working with existing activities already supporting transformation, rather than necessarily trying to create new ones4. Deliberate transformation can thus be viewed as a process of cohering systemic activities, so they reinforce each other. 

Fourth, multiple forms of governance are needed to ensure: the current system does not collapse (H1); entrepreneurial, high risk, activities aimed at change are supported (H2); long-term explorations can thrive (H3); and that resources from the present system are re-allocated to create the new4. Ultimately, provision of hospices for the old and midwifery for the new are needed for such re-allocation to occur7. 

Finally, using Three Horizons highlights that deliberate transformation along the idealised pattern of the Three Horizons framework is possible, but very rare4. Most human endeavors fail to support transformation because they lack the strategic action needed to overcome the strong pull of the existing system and because there is usually a limited mandate – publicly and politically – for genuine change to occur4. Three Horizons practice, while having limits, has at least been developed with such challenges in mind. It enhances consciousness about how the present gives rise to the future and how action can be oriented for a fundamentally new future to arise1.

5,05/10/2023 16:05:46,sophie.caillon@cefe.cnrs.fr,Caillon Sophie,CNRS UMR 5175 CEFE,Ethnoecology,"Ethnoecology is the discipline that studies the dynamic relationships between humans and their material and immaterial space, by examining how space is perceived by humans (local knowledge), and how humans, according to their ontologies, live their landscapes by transforming and using their natural resources (practices) (inspired from Ellen, 2006). The term ""live"" includes using, managing, transforming and thinking about natural entities, places and spaces on a technical, material and symbolic level, in other words, taking into account all cognitive dimensions; material and immaterial cultures are therefore jointly called upon in ethnoecology. Each human group develops its own unique way of seeing and interacting with the world. The aim of ethnoecology is to show this diversity of singularities, and in particular the wealth of links, care, attachments - in short, the commitments of humans to non-humans, and vice versa. These relationships are not only ethical or spiritual, but also physical. Ethnoecology is as interested in the complexity of the human world as it is in that of non-humans or the supranatural; the landscape scale is thus summoned (Johnson & Hunt, 2011; Hunn & Selam, 1990).
Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches, ethnoecologists are able to probe and analyze local ontologies from a holistic, emic (""from within"") perspective, and make them comprehensible to the bearers of other ontologies. Ethnoecology is a discipline based on field observations; our ideas and inspirations come from the humans and non-humans we encounter. Thus, to understand the processes, relationships, forms of organization and thought of a given social group, it is more important to observe than to investigate with (and not about) the social groups under consideration. We call this way of relating to the subject and the field work a biocultural approach. This type of approach makes it possible to encompass both the biological and cultural aspects of a system, and to deal with complex relationships and feedbacks between human and ecological systems (Caillon et al., 2017; Gavin et al., 2015). Ethnoecology is a holistic science of interactions and processes between humans and non-humans.","Caillon, S., Cullman, G., Verschuuren, B., & Sterling, E. J. (2017).

In Ethnobiology (Wiley-Blackwell, p. 267‑280).","Ethnoecology covers a wide range of research fields: by describing practices, knowledge and uses, ethnoecologists collaborate with ecologists on questions of biodiversity conservation or resource sustainability; by studying more specifically the dynamics over time of these same knowledge and practices, ethnoecologists are interested in the impacts of globalization and climate change on biocultural systems, and the way in which these systems integrate changes by investing in areas such as resilience or cultural adaptation ; inventorying local names and classification systems, as well as plant and animal circulation networks, adds a historical perspective to domestication and migration processes; qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing knowledge transmission mechanisms helps to better understand cultural and biological erosion phenomena. All these fields of research contribute to transformative change.
Ethnoecology also helps the pursuit of transformative change through its methods. First and foremost, ethnoecologists carry out ethical and, where possible, committed research (Posey, 1983). Darrell Posey, an entomologist turned ethnoecologist among the Kayapó in Brazil, was the driving force behind the ""Belèm Declaration"" at the first International Society of Ethnobiology symposium in 1988, which insisted on the recognition of indigenous peoples' right to their local knowledge (Soldati & Albuquerque, 2016).
The biocultural approach on which ethnoecology is based offers a flexible framework that facilitates synthesis between different metrics, knowledge systems and ontologies by integrating connections - including convergences and divergences - between local and academic knowledge (Sterling et al., 2017).

Transformative change requires stewarding complex social, cultural, ecological, economic, institutional and technological systems towards more desirable configurations as well as to foster human agency and those capacities necessary to create change (Caniglia et al. 2021). Transformative processes simultaneously involve and engage with the practical, political, and personal spheres (O’Brien 2012). 

The driving and motivating question of transformative sustainability science is: how can we generate knowledge and create capacities to transform our societies and generate a more just, inclusive and sustainable world? This new  research field aims to generate new knowledge emerging from (and supporting)  actions addressing the need for deep and enduring societal changes (Fazey et al. 2018). Such actions are adaptive and emergent processes that enhance learning and build individual and collective capacities to initiate or reinforce plural pathways towards alternative, emancipatory and more desirable futures. In generating knowledge for transformative change, importantly, different knowledge systems and ways of knowing need to be engaged, especially those of marginalized and vulnerable populations, such as Indigenous people (Tengö et al. 2017). Further, different kinds of knowledge are necessary, such as strategic knowledge supporting intentional design of actions, empowering knowledge enhancing shared agency, and situated knowledge enabling contextual realization (Caniglia et al. 2021). 

Contributing to transformative change requires new, collaborative approaches that consider how to nurture transformations by “taking diverse knowledges seriously,” “taking politics seriously,” and “taking plural pathways seriously” (Scoones et al. 2020, 70). Working with the complexities of (un)sustainability rather involves working recursively with the contrasting values and power dynamics that underlie different views about what it means to create change, for whom is change created and by whom (Turnhout et al. 2020). Social–ecological and socio–technical experiments, place-based and transdisciplinary projects, experiments in real-world laboratories and action-oriented projects in higher education are examples of research aiming to learn how to bring about such change.

","Transformative sustainability science in its different forms relies on knowledge co-production and transdisciplinary approaches in order to generate knowledge and change. These approaches reject the idea that knowledge is first generated through research and then translated or disseminated into society. Methodologies are here often referred to as knowledge co-production or transdisciplinarity, as they integrate perspectives and focus on processes and relationships that increase engagement and traction with policy makers, practitioners and other actors, including citizens (Chambers et al. 2022). Rather, knowledge should emerge from entangled processes of action, mutual learning and capacity building. The promise and aspiration of knowledge co-production consists in developing solutions through legitimate processes that draw on diverse and credible expertise with, by and for those best placed to use them through different research modes and priorities:  (1) researching solutions; (2) empowering voices; (3) brokering power; (4) reframing power; (5) navigating differences and (6) reframing agency (Chambers et al. 2021). 

In transformative approaches in sustainability science, scholars work together with multiple societal actors to contribute to creating transformative change towards sustainability in ways that are situated in context, pluralistic, goal-oriented and interactive (Norström et al. 2020).  In order to contribute to transformative change, knowledge co-production also requires critical and transgressive elements, as the capacity to question and overcome oppressive social norms, such as ableism, racism, classicism, elitism, sexism, (Vogel and O’Brien 2021). Co-production processes aspire to generate change on multiple dimensions and levels. On the personal and interpersonal level, transformative knowledge co-production processes draw attention to the quality of relationships, involving being respectful of various ways of knowing and perceiving what is real (Rigolot 2020) as well as developing capacities for navigating complex situations of conflict and disagreement towards good outcomes (Caniglia et al. 2023). Furthermore, knowledge co-production may create spaces and conditions for transformative change (Pereira et al. 2020). Such spaces represent more than opportunities for dialogues, but are rather carefully crafted spaces where people can discuss, debate, and co-create complex futures. These spaces create the conditions for shifting system states in ways which may be unexpected but that reflect the values and visions of those involved.

By focusing on the impact of human activity on the biosphere, the environmental perspective not only opens new topics of investigation but also changes our understanding of the emergence of the modern world (Burke III, E., & Pomeranz, 2009). The Environmentalism of the Poors arises from social conflicts over environmental rights or titles because of the risks of pollution and the loss of access to natural resources and environmental services (Martínez Alier, 2002). Environmental coloniality helps explain injustice through history (Grove, 1995; Carney & Rosomoff, 2009; Ferdinand, 2019).

Edward Elgar Publishing.","According to environmental history and frameworks of environmental conflicts and environmental injustice and inequalities, intentional transformative change occurs when all actors involved in an environmental conflict become aware of the role they have played in environmental degradation. Such transformative change is often translated into agreements between the parties involved through environmental mediation. It is also often translated into legal agreements or public policies when the actors include public or legal administrations. On the other hand, the awareness gained through history and shared environmental memory is transmitted through social communication and education (Gadgil & Guha, 1995).
The drivers of change are threefold. Firstly, the emergence of environmental mediation and conflict resolution tools. Second, the involvement of all stakeholders in a system of truth, reparation and justice, such as in cases of human rights violations and dispossession. Thirdly, history and memory must be transmitted and taught. The transmission, memory and environmental oblivion of each culture can, thanks to environmental history, be recovered as a socio-cultural driver (Escobar, 2008). The history of the interaction between humans, animals, flora and natural resources needs to be understood locally and globally for its transformation (Cariño & Ortega Santos, 2014).
Actors: the reconstruction of any environmental past, such as the extinction of a species or the pollution of a mangrove swamp, must include the history of each actor, including residents, stakeholders, industrialists and agricultural entrepreneurs (González de Molina, 2020), hunters, fishers, farmers (Funes Monzote, 2008), environmental and scientific experts, local representative actors, associations, administrations, justice systems, army, etc.
The causes of biodiversity loss are rooted in inequality and environmental injustice. An actor who knows, who is, or who has more power than another, causes further damage to biodiversity loss. To prevent this, thanks to environmental history and environmentalim of the poors, we know the histories behind this lost. Environmental history provides us with concrete local and global data that can help us understand the loss of biodiversity and how to maintain the balance and improve the environment. With environmental history, an inclusive process of restoring biodiversity can be made collectively through a powerful common narrative.","Escobar, A. (2008). Territories of difference.

It is used in a wide variety of disciplines like sustainability science, health sciences, development studies, and education. Consequently, there is considerable variety in the way the concept interpreted and used. Stakeholders (those that can affect or are affected by the issue being researched) are typically involved in co-producing knowledge, often with the intent to help “capture the voices and experiences of under-represented, marginalised or hard-to-reach groups in society” (Schubotz, 2020). In participatory research, power is shifted towards stakeholders, who may be involved in formulating research questions, developing study design, collecting and analysing data, disseminating findings, and/or taking action (Cornwall & Jewkes, 1995; Vaughn, & Jacquez, 2020). Stakeholder participation can also vary in extent, from informing (where stakeholder have the least power), to consulting, involving, collaborating with, or empowering stakeholders (most power) (Arnstein, 1969; Vaughn, & Jacquez, 2020). It is important to note that participation is not ‘better’ if stakeholders are involved at more stages in the research process or to a greater extent. Rather, it is more important that participation is appropriate to stakeholder needs and wants and the needs of the research in question (Blackstock et al., 2007).","Arnstein, S. R. (1969).

It typically involves researchers from academic institutions, (inter-)governmental, and/or non-governmental organisations. Other stakeholders involved vary depending on context and may include: actors from government; non-governmental policy makers; non-governmental organisations; business and industry; educators and students; media; local communities; Indigenous peoples; and workers and trade unions.

Participatory research contributes to transformative change towards sustainability by embodying sustainability values in research (‘being the change you want to see’) by including stakeholders in matters they affect or are affected by (Fiorino, 1990). It improves the quality of research by sourcing knowledge and perspectives from many different actors to ask more appropriate questions (Schubotz, 2020), offers a more complete picture of the issue being studied (Fiorino, 1990), and contributes to social learning (Collins & Ison, 2009). It can cover broad geographic areas that are too costly for traditional research (e.g., citizen science collecting data for global biodiversity monitoring), or be used to study culturally sensitive topics (e.g., studying species with cultural value to Indigenous peoples) (Krueger and King, 1998). Participatory research can increase legitimacy of research outputs amongst stakeholders, and therefore the possibility that the research contributes to material changes in society (Fiorino, 1990). Participatory research can also empower stakeholders to engage in transformative collective action, sometimes through the research process (e.g., action research) (Tandon, 1988).

Participatory research addresses biodiversity loss by empowering stakeholders, and providing a better understanding of the problem, the mechanisms through which it is caused, and how it might best be addressed. It also increases the likelihood that action to address biodiversity loss will be informed by these improved understandings. Ongoing participatory research is necessary to respond and adapt to emergent challenges and opportunities that present during transformative change processes.","Collins, K., & Ison, R. (2009).

9,09/10/2023 13:23:44,a.o.manlosa@luc.leidenuniv.nl,Aisa O. Manlosa,Leiden University,Human Agency,"Human agency is a critically important factor for ensuring that sustainability transformation in any given social-ecological system places social justice and equity at the center alongside meeting environmental goals. The term human agency is multi-faceted. It involves an individual’s capacity to freely make choices (Brown and Westaway 2011), the capacity to define one’s goals and act on them (Kabeer 1999), and the capacity to play an independent causal role in history (McLaughlin and Dietz 2008). The exercise of human agency goes beyond observable action and includes the less visible aspects of the meanings, motivations, and purposes that animate people’s activities (Kabeer 1999; Manlosa 2022). While much of literature views agency as a matter of decision-making, Kabeer (1999) considers a more nuanced view to include bargaining, negotiation, non-action as resistance, and invisible cognitive processes of reflection and analysis as exercises of agency. While agency is primarily an individual’s capacity, it can also be possessed by groups (McLaughlin and Dietz 2008) in collective action. The concept of human agency contributes to transformative change research. One of the earlier research strands linking human agency and transformative change was done by feminist scholars theorising the processes through which human agency contributes to gender transformative change towards more equal gender and power relations (Kantor 2013). The discourse on sustainability transformation is much broader but some of the linkages are similar. For instance, the setting of goals to guide the direction of sustainability transformation includes the exercise of human agency. Questions of whose goals, raises issues around which groups have the opportunity to play causal roles in transformation processes in their own places. Complex decision-making and the power of participatory processes to amplify the voices of marginalised groups similarly involves the analysis and exercise of human agency of diverse social groups. Thus, human agency is foundational to the sustainability transformation discourse. ","Alkire, S. 2007. Measuring agency: issues and possibilities.

","Intentional transformative change occurs in social-ecological systems of different scales when a new system emerges from the old one. This goes beyond surface-level changes. Transformative change occurs through different mechanisms including, among others, 1) an intentional change of system goals in order to put the system in a new trajectory, 2) a change in the structure of a system, and 3) an alteration of the feedbacks between system components, such that a new social-ecological regime emerges. Human agency plays a role in these three different mechanisms. First, the setting of new goals is an exercise of agency. Ensuring that goal-setting is not narrowly captured by privileged, powerful voices but broadly reflects diverse voices in a way that is just and equitable requires that different social groups are supported and given opportunities to exercise agency in shaping the course of transformation in specific places. Second, changing the structure of a system, for instance by changing institutions and social structures to serve sustainability goals necessitate human actors to engage in decision-making, goal setting, and deliberate visible and invisible processes that involve the exercise of human agency. Third, it must be noted that complex social-ecological transformation processes involve both agentic and non-agentic aspects. This means that part of the series of changes leading to transformation are random, involve non-intentional drivers, feedback, and effects. But intentional transformative change occurs because actors can learn and shape responses and feedbacks between system components.","Charli-Joseph, L., Siqueiros-Garcia, J.

Garibaldi,Universidad Nacional de Río Negro (UNRN),Agroecological Transformations,"Conventional agriculture has been a major driver of environmental degradation, with the expansion of the agricultural frontier displacing natural areas and intensifying land use (Tscharntke et al., 2005). This has led to increased deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and global biodiversity loss, which in turn have reduced the natural capital of agroecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem services (Tilman et al., 2002). However, these environments have the potential to contribute to multiple dimensions of human well-being, and proper management can resolve trade-offs between production, food security, and people's quality of life. Building natural capital over the long term, such as fertile soils and more positive biotic interactions, is crucial for sustainable food systems (Tittonell et al., 2020).

Agroecological transformation is an interactive horizontal change that promotes shared learning and creative solutions. It aims to comprehensively transform agroecosystems to function based on ecological processes driven by diversification strategies inside and outside the fields (Altieri et al., 2018). Both a multidisciplinary science and a social movement (Wezel et al., 2009), agroecology can be implemented in systems of any scale because it is highly context-dependent, and its principles adapt to each case. It comprises practices as diverse as intercropping, integrated pest management, dry mulching, and water infiltration, relying most of all on a participatory approach that brings together actors from the productive, academic, political, and public sectors with a common vision. Assistance from various sectors may involve technology transfers, from optimizations at the logistics level in field management to service provisioning and improvements in existing farming tools.","Altieri, M.

However, as resources are depleted, pesticides are overused, natural enemies and pollinators are lost, pollution and climate change increase, and other factors worsen, the productivity of these systems falters (Tittonell et al., 2020). This leads to a search for safer, more accessible ways of producing food that also increase the sustainability and resilience of agroecosystems and reverse biodiversity loss (Jones et al., 2022).

Agroecological transitions contribute to transformative change by creating integrated land-use systems that improve ecological processes while strengthening local communities (Andrieu & Kebede, 2020). The goal is to comprehensively transform landscapes to function based on biodiversity strategies. However, this approach is not limited to proposing a set of new practices. By recognizing the socio-ecological dimension of the food system, it implies a paradigm shift in production (Peeters et al., 2021).

Efficient provision of ecosystem services in agroecosystems can lead to lower production costs for farmers and even alternative sources of income. Communities that adopt agroecological strategies will often form networks that foster more direct relationships in marketing, such as community agriculture (Andrieu & Kebede, 2020). Thus, agroecological initiatives can enable progress in reterritorializing agricultural and food systems. Another benefit is that diverse landscapes provide more jobs (Garibaldi & Pérez-Méndez, 2019). Conversion also brings social benefits through education and emotional well-being.

Yet, the complexity of system changes can be a barrier to their implementation. Incentives for good agricultural practices can lead to more efficient use of external inputs, but they are insufficient to encourage full transitions (Tittonell et al., 2020). Because of this, initiatives worldwide aim to contribute to real change by encouraging producers to develop solutions to challenges with long-term outcomes based on local needs and capacities. Agroecological systems are based on local communities' culture and identity, allowing less-represented groups decentralized access to resources, land, and tools (Andrieu & Kebede, 2020). Trust-based relationships are key to fostering public-private partnerships and changing regulations to achieve change at all levels (Jones et al., 2022).","Andrieu, N., & Kebede, Y. (2020).

Arizona State University",Phases of deliberate social-ecological transformations,"Inspired by the four-phases adaptation cycle, Olsson et al (2004) proposed that social-ecological transformations generally take place in three phases: (1) preparing for change, (2) navigating the transition, and (3) building resilience of the new trajectory of development. The framework was expanded by describing subprocesses that occur within each phase and emphasizing the role of power and agency for the case of deliberate, purposeful or intentional social-ecological transformations (Moore et al. 2014). Deliberate transformation theory engages with the political, as well as the inner dimensions of transformations through questioning the assumptions, beliefs, values, commitments, loyalties and interests that support current structures, systems, and behaviors (O’Brien 2012; Manuel-Navarrete and Pelling 2015). Considering the complex interactions between agency and structural factors in particular social-ecological systems, Andrachuk et al. (2018) proposed a “building blocks” heuristic to complement the three-phases model. This heuristic recognizes the interplay of bottom-up and top-down perspectives on how to foster meaningful and lasting changes.","Andrachuk, M., Armitage, D., Hoang, H. D., & Van Le, N. (2018).

One major concept from this theory delineates a four-phase adaptive cycle, encompassing exploitation, conservation, release, and reorganization, with each adaptive cycle connected across scales, to at least one adaptive cycle “above” and “below” that scale and numerous others alongside.
 
The two phases of the “front loop” of the cycle are relatively slow, involving resource accumulation and institutionalization of that system state. However, the flexibility and diversity of the system are reduced in these phases, affecting its capacity to respond to external shocks. Then, if the state of that SES is disrupted, it may open up space for new opportunities and innovations that might shape the reorganization of a new system (the “back loop”). A system that has resilience is able to move between all of these phases of the cycle without facing total collapse. The panarchy – the cross-scale connections of multiple adaptive cycles – also shapes the SES through dynamics such as remembrance (i.e., SE memory that provides context and experience after collapse) and revolt (which arises from the interactions between radical niches that aim to break down the status quo), which are key for understanding and guiding transformative change (Olsson et al 2022). 

Subsequent developments in the field of resilience science have built upon panarchy theory by highlighting three key aspects that are required for resilience: persistence, adaptability, and transformability (Folke et al 2010). In particular, scholars have underscored the critical role of resilience in SES transformations in both destabilizing existing undesirable systems and strengthening emerging ones. Three phases typically proceed SES transformations, namely, the preparing, navigating, and stabilizing phase (Olsson et al 2014); and each phase requires specific capacities for fostering SES transformations (Westley et al 2013).

","Shifting from the current trajectories of biodiversity loss remains a paramount concern for SES transformations research. Much empirical work has focused on governance transformations of ecosystems and their biodiversity.

Transformations toward sustainable and just futures require fundamental changes in the configuration of power and resource distribution within a given social system, the practices and processes upholding these configurations, the underlying norms, values, and beliefs, and their interconnections with ecological systems across multiple scales (Moore & Milkoreit 2020). Thus, some relationships in existing systems will need to be “unmade” while others will need to be re-made, both among people and between people and their ecosystems. 

Diverse drivers of change (e.g., attractors, external forces, or bottom-up pressure) can create an opportunity context that reduces the resilience of the existing dominant regime and (potentially) facilitates transformations to more desirable trajectories (Elmqvist et al 2019). Once the dominant regime becomes destabilized, innovations experimented with by niche actors during the preparation phase may gain momentum, potentially catalyzing the emergence of a new regime (Moore et al 2023). But this requires different capacities at different times, and many actors will be trying to ensure the transformation goes in their preferred direction. Consequently, there will be contestation, as multiple (and sometimes competing) ideas and approaches are assessed and combined (navigation phase). There is also a risk that the legacy of the previous regime may exert pressure (the “remembrance” dynamic), potentially coercing the disruptive potential of these innovations. In such cases, the innovations could be absorbed or coopted by the business-as-usual practices (Herrfahrdt-Pähle et al 2020). Transformations will require deep learning and reflexivity practices given the shifts in power and resource structures and flows needed, the creation of spaces for innovations to emerge, and support for networks working on the different aspects of transformations (Tuckey et al 2023)

Catalysis draws from the idea that paradigm shift in, for example, how humans understand their relationship to nature and other-than-human beings, drives economic and societal activities that impact the natural world (Meadows, 1999).  The idea of catalysis (Hussein et al., 2018) builds on a systems-based understanding that draws from complexity theory, based on understanding that bringing together multiple actors into greater coherence and action can lend impact to their transformation activities thereby developing potential to overcome vested interested to shift towards more equitable, flourishing socioecological systems.

","How Catalyzing Transformation Creates Purposeful Change: Recognizing the uniqueness of each socioecological context, catalyzing transformation offers a process-based approach to purposeful whole system transformation that can be applied and adapted as contextually needed (Waddock, 2023). The core idea is that change agents with significant self-awareness and other change capabilities (Wamsler, 2020), act as a transformation catalysts (Waddock & Waddell, 2021). Transformation catalysts work to purposefully convene and align multiple change agents with shared aspirations to enable them to co-creatively and collectively become effective transformation systems (Waddock et al., 2022). Transformation catalysts operate through three main processes: connecting, cohering, and amplifying. Connecting involves enabling convened change agents to collectively ‘see’ and understand their system using a range of stakeholder analyses and mapping processes, and then make sense of what needs to change and how in a process broadly termed sensemaking. Cohering involves engaging change agents in processes through which convened actors collectively and co-creatively envision and co-emerge shared aspirations or desired futures using a range of possible collective visualization techniques (e.g., Sharpe et al., 2016). They then co-generate action plans to achieve those aspirations (i.e., visions, goals, desired futures) both collectively and independently as feasible. Amplification involves establishing an effective and purposeful transformation system in which actors implement action plans, sometimes experimentally, learning from and adapting them as necessary. To maintain change processes, they further develop additional catalytic actors to convene subsystem transformation systems as needed (Waddock, 2023). This approach can be applied in contextually-appropriate ways to many different systems and subsystems, adapting the processes of connecting, cohering, and amplifying to fit the  circumstances through adopting life-centered, stewardship, values-driven, and complexity-based organizing and design principles that enhance the flourishing of human as well as other-than-human life.

Current visions of the future are dominated by dystopian visions of the future, while scientific visions are often overly optimistic expectations of change despite business-as-usual approaches. The lack of a wider variety of alternative futures, and the methods to create them presents a barrier to innovation and action (Pereira et al. 2019). Complexity and resilience approaches are particularly well-suited to the challenge of transforming to a more sustainable Anthropocene because of the uncertainty, novelty, and uneven nature of transformative change. While most theories of change feature gradual change of dominant systems, the Seeds of Good Anthropocene approach is based on the idea that the world is more diverse and surprising, and that transformative change often comes from the combination of existing marginal experiments. A high diversity of experiments towards change is essential to provide response diversity that enables a system to cope with surprises and shocks.","Bennett, E.M., Solan, M., Biggs, R., MacPhearson, T., Norstrom, A., Olsson, P.,  Pereira, L., Peterson, G.D., Raudsepp-Hearne, C., Beirmann, F., Carpenter, S.R., Ellis, E., Hichert, T.

One Earth 4, February 19, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2021.01.004","The Seeds of Good Anthropocene is based on the idea that many possible futures are embedded in the present. As people notice problems in the world, they take action to address those problems, and an important step for fostering global transformation is to highlight those actions. These actions begin as isolated experiments. Highlighting them shows the plurality of visions of a better future; it allows for studies of when, where, why, and how different approaches toward transformation work (or don’t); it fosters further action via empowerment; and it might help build shadow networks among seeds. This can lead to an emerging awareness of the need for change, and, ultimately new meta-narratives about changing practices, values, and structures. Windows of opportunity can open through crisis, political opportunity, or other changes in the system, leading to openness to a new regime being institutionalised through changing structures such as policies, as well as through more widespread change in values and practices.

The theory of change of the Seeds of Good Anthropocene approach proposes that large (macro-scale) changes emerge from substantial periods of experimentation at the micro-level that lead to the formation of new coalitions. The preparation phase (involving periods of experimentation and coalescing) and the navigation phases are linked by a window of opportunity or the opening up of an opportunity context. This can be a crisis, or anticipated crisis, that destabilizes the existing regime and/or makes opportunities for intentional change more visible or transparent. This window of opportunity allows the coalitions of interacting actors, groups and processes emerging from the preparation phase to begin to become institutionalized at the meso-level. Understanding of how these meso-scale organizations grow to be dominant, collapse, or are co-opted by existing macro-scale remains limited.

Highlighting them shows the plurality of visions of a better future; it allows for studies of when, where, why and how different approaches toward transformation work (or don’t); it fosters further action via empowerment; and it might help build shadow networks among seeds. This can lead to an emerging awareness of the need for change and, ultimately new meta-narratives about changing practices, values and structures. Windows of opportunity can open through crisis, political opportunity, or other changes in the system, leading to openness to a new regime being institutionalised through changing structures such as policies, as well as through more widespread change in values and practices.",,"The theory of change of the Seeds of Good Anthropocene approach proposes that large (macro-scale) changes emerge from substantial periods of experimentation at the micro-level that lead to the formation of new coalitions. The preparation phase (involving periods of experimentation and coalescing) and the navigation phases are linked by a window of opportunity or the opening up of an opportunity context. This can be a crisis, or anticipated crisis, that destabilises the existing regime and/or makes opportunities for intentional change more visible or transparent. This window of opportunity allows the coalitions of interacting actors, groups and processes emerging from the preparation phase to begin to become institutionalised at the meso-level. Understanding of how these meso-scale organizations grow to be dominant, collapse, or are co-opted by existing macro-scale remains limited."

The social-ecological systems framework developed by Elinor Ostrom and colleagues (Ostrom 2009, McGinnis and Ostrom 2014) is a comprehensive empirically-based tool for diagnosing the variables hindering or enabling collective action at the interface of people and nature. The framework provides organized sets of variables in eight first-tier categories, with the central four being Governance, Actors, Resource Users and Resource systems. Each first-tier category contains nested second-tier variables – 56 in total - that are more specific such as resource system productivity, property rights, leadership and economic value. The logic of the framework is to provide a comprehensive diagnostic checklist of the empirically-backed variables that may be influencing collective action in the commons - which are understood as social-ecological systems - such as a fishery, urban gardens or land for pastoralists. Similar to medical doctors, sustainablity scholars can use the framework to diagnose collective action and sustainablity outcome problems with the framework by first assessing the role of each variable in the system of interest, and then narrowing those down to the underlying factors that can be addressed with governance interventions to enable tranformative changes in the system’s functionality towards more desireable outcomes (Cox 2011). Both social and biophyiscal variables shape collective action processes, and the characteristics of those variables can make it easier or harder for groups to work together and transform the system effectively. Recent reviews of the literature have suggested it‘s evolution into sub-frameworks tailored to specific sectors to more effectively define and measure common variables (Partelow 2018). Applying the framework requires interdsciplinary qualitative and quantitative methods, where recent guidelines have been proposed (Nagel and Partelow 2022).  ","Cox, M. 2011.

Solutions also emerge as a result of the dynamic interaction between individual and collective actions. Individuals can contribute to sustainable pathways incrementally through their consumption and lifestyle choices, while also collectively influencing social structures through both implicit and explicit support for systemic change (O’Brien & Sygna, 2013). Because social systems and human actions are deeply interconnected, both top-down and bottom-up approaches are necessary to achieve transformative change (Geels & Schot, 2007).

An integrative framework for transformative social change elucidates various pathways to advance environmental sustainability, explicitly treating both behavioral and social structural processes as interdependent elements for system feedbacks (Naito et al., 2022). Through behavioral processes, individuals play a crucial role in affecting social systems that in turn enable or constrain individual actions. In particular, the framework distinguishes between three types of individual actions that contribute differently to transformative change: private action that people take independently to reduce their environmental footprints (e.g., recycling); social-signaling action that people conduct to signal their environmental values (e.g., opinion sharing); and system-changing action that people engage in with a clear intent of influencing laws, policies, and corporate actions (e.g., protesting). In social structural processes, it is important to analyze how existing institutions, social norms, economic systems, and infrastructures are arranged and how they facilitate conditions that perpetuate environmental problems. Removing barriers to or enhancing the enablers of change within social structures is key to achieving rapid and dynamic transformations. 

The framework suggests that transformative change can be initiated from any points within either the behavioral or structural processes. However, it ultimately requires change across all aspects to establish and diffuse new pro-environmental norms (Otto et al., 2020).","Geels, F. W., & Schot, J. (2007).

It requires the widespread adoption of sustainable behaviors from the committed minority to the general public. Additionally, it requires fundamental shifts in the systems that facilitate sustainable practices at the societal level.

The behavioral intervention process should involve engaging people in not only private actions but also civic actions that might collectively help shift social norms, institutions, and infrastructures (Chan et al., 2020). Behavioral interventions may benefit from tailoring their approaches to specific types of individual actions, as these actions are influenced by unique sets of social and psychological factors (Naito et al., 2023). Interventions that effectively target social and psychological factors can produce behavior change and potentially mobilize a large number of individuals to take pro-environmental actions. In the context of transformative change, motivating people to participate in civic actions (i.e., social-signaling and system-changing actions) is particularly important, as these actions can generate ripples that extend outward through societies, potentially leading to more significant impacts once a tipping point is reached (Constantino et al., 2022).

The structural intervention process focuses on changing the current arrangements of institutions, policies, infrastructures, and economic systems that can lock in most forms of social interactions and practices for a long time. Interventions need to address the barriers and enablers of transformative change within the systems at various administrative and geographical levels, spanning from local to global (Bodin, 2017).

Transformative change is, however defined, structural. Drawing on insights from complexity theory, the concept of transitions points at the patterns and mechanisms underlying such structural change in systems: transitions are a non-linear shift from one dynamic equilibrium to another. From natural and environmental sciences, we understand transitions as outcome of processes of self-organisation, emergence and co-evolution that can keep a complex system dynamically stable. But when the context changes and the system is unable to adapt tipping points occur (Folke et al., 2004). Sustainability transitions research (D. Loorbach et al., 2017) explores what this could mean for transitions in the making by combining it with insights from social sciences.   

In complex societal systems transformative change is less straightforward: positions of actors, experiences, expectations, interests, emotions, power, imagination, and preferences make societal transitions ambiguous, contested and uncertain (Rotmans & al, 2001). Yet the basic pattern has proven to be repetitive and predictable. In societal systems, actors develop so-called ‘regimes’ (shared cultures, structures, and practices) that provide stability but also create path dependency (Rip, 1995). Over time ultimately context changes (technological, geopolitical, demographic changes combined with increasing sustainability concerns), internal lock-in and emerging alternatives will make established regimes ‘unsustainable’ and drive it out-of-equilibrium.    

The X-curve (Hebinck et al., 2022) identifies the different co-evolving patterns of increasingly destabilizing regime structures and emerging alternative technologies, practices, norms, structures and models. In this process actors will experience and develop sense of urgency, awareness and opportunity in different ways and start to work to accelerate or work against transformative pressures building up. Typically established (incumbent) actors are more likely to seek control, stability and avoid chaos and breakdown, while external actors and social innovations search for it. The understanding of transformative change in terms of the patterns and mechanisms underlying transitions does not provide a blueprint for action but it does offer a basis for new forms of governance that can influence the speed and direction of these emergent and semi-autonomous processes.

 ","Intentional transformative change: transition management   
Intentional transformative change, or transitions management, combines four types of strategies that should be combined to support transformative change (Loorbach, 2022). First, anchoring ambitions to achieve a nature positive economy (NPE) that benefits people and planet rather than to reduce negative impacts of the existing. Second, institutional support for the acceleration, diffusion and scaling of new structures, cultures and practices in support of a NPE. Third, adaptation and adjustment of existing institutional conditions to fit a NPE. Finally, a dedicated and managed decline and phase-out of unsustainable, fossil and linear parts of the economy.     

Societal transitions are socially constructed: how actors respond to (perceived need for) transformative change determines its pattern, pathways and outcomes. Research into the agency in transitions (Grin et al., 2011a) identifies the different strategies and actions that either reinforce path dependencies or explore alternatives. They make clear that institutionalized approaches (public and private) prioritize technological innovation and controlled ways to improve existing economic systems (Smink et al., 2015). Work on transformative innovation policy (Diercks et al., 2019) and transformative government (Braams et al., 2021) explores how formal policies could be redesigned to support transformative rather than incremental change.

Yet it is also found that types of agency that drive transformative change typically emerge outside institutions in the form of transformative social innovation (TSI). TSI refers to new ways of ‘thinking, doing and organizing that challenge, alter or replace an incumbent regime’ (Avelino et al., 2019). These might involve civil servants, entrepreneurs, citizens, researchers, or other societal actors that develop niches wherein they experimentally develop alternatives. The underlying governance logic is based on a critical view of the status quo, backcasting from a desired future, selective networking, and a learning-by-doing approach. These principles have provided the basis for transition management, a governance approach seeking to influence both regime-led and niche-based types of agency for desired transitions (Grin et al., 2011b).

As a distinctive forms of contentious politics, social movements involve collective claims-making which, if realized, would conflict with someone else’s interests. They also act as a counterweight to oppressive power, as a summons to popular action against a wide range of injustices (Tilly and Wood, 2018). 
Social movements theories have highlighted the political aspect of the contentions that give to collective action. This is so because governments, in their various forms, participate as key players, whether as claimants, as actors in the claim making, objects or allies of claims, or as monitors of the contention (Mc Adam, Tarrow and Tilly, 2001). 
Different theories have focused on different dimensions of these social processes. Among the most relevant perspectives, the resource mobilization theory, drawing on a rational choice approach, have focused on the assets and capacities of aggrieved groups. Resources may be tangible, such as money and facilities, and intangible, such as the solidarities, cultural commitments, and identity networks (Jenkins, 2001).
Other theories have focused on the social movements’ shared collective identity. Collective identity here refers to imagined as well as concrete communities. As a fluid and relational process, it involves an act of perception and construction, as well as the discovery of preexisting bonds, interests, and boundaries (Polleta and Jasper, 2001). Other analytical perspectives have focused on political opportunities, taking into account the multiplicity of independent centers of power within the polity, the openness of the polity to new actors, the instability of current political alignments, and the availability of influential allies or supporters - within which activists are making claims (Tilly, 1993). The rise and fall of social movements mark the expansion and contraction of democratic opportunities (Tilly and Wood, 2018).","Diani, M. (1992). The concept of social movement.

The focus on agency, power, institutions as well as behaviour, expectations, emotions and culture is referred to as the socio-institutional perspective. It builds on the insights from sustainability transitions research that unsustainabilities are grounded in persistent societal regimes and that transitions are non-linear disruptive processes, which are both driven and worked against by different types of strategies and actions of actors. Transition then refers to the structural reconfiguration, involving patterns of build-up and breakdown, from one stable societal system to another. This process of change evolves over decades. Transition governance identifies ways of and for actors to cope with the challenges of navigating complex, ambiguous and uncertain contexts towards just sustainability. 

Societal regimes are the dominant cultures, structures, and practices in a complex societal system that remain in a dynamic equilibrium. Vested interests, established routines, discourse, and institutional conditions create path-dependencies and lock-ins that resist more structural change. These societal regimes provide stability to the system as well as inertia by being wired to resist change. Societal regimes generally have an interest in sustaining the status-quo and will work against transformative change, until it is inevitable.

Alternatives to these societal regimes often emerge as a response to feelings of discontent as to how the societal regime operates and (dis)functions. These innovations can be considered radical, alternative, marginalised, and outside the social norm. Initially, these emerge in protected environments, beyond the reach of the regime, allowing alternatives practices to be ‘nurtured’. Over time, some alternatives become better organised, visible, and understood, contributing to further diffusion of these alternative – allowing them to spread, scale, or translate into other contexts, until they become a viable, stable alternative to the dominant system. As not all alternatives succeed, diversity and experimentation are vital. ","Loorbach, D., Frantzeskaki, N. & Avelino, F.

(Earthscan, 2015).","Transition governance aims to identify the different types of agency that influence transition processes and to support actors in navigating societal transitions by focussing on ‘transitions in the making’. Characteristic of these emerging patterns of transformative change that might lead to full transitions, is an increasing urgency to explore breakdown of unwanted (locked-in) practices in relation to the build-up of desired practices. Being part of transitions in the making proves to be chaotic, turbulent, and unstructured: Societal actors find this increasingly difficult to gauge and respond very differently to transformative pressures that develop. Overcoming the dysfunctional legacies of the unsustainable societal regime and to allow for fundamental reconfiguration of the system are key to transition governance. 

While current regimes prioritize technological innovation, fostering intentional transformative change relies on transformative social innovation: ‘new ways of thinking, doing, and organizing’ that ‘challenge, alter, or replace’ dominant structures, cultures, and practices of unsustainable societal regimes. Embracing a plurality in perspectives and engage with diverse societal actors by overcoming the dichotomies between state, market, and community, is crucial. Not only does this broaden the notion of what is considered expert knowledge used for governance, but it also empowers different type of actors as ‘agents of change’, enabling change in a multitude of ways. This in turn, creates space for transformative social innovations to flourish and experiment with alternatives to the dominant structures.

Lastly, reconceptualising ‘power’ is vital to acknowledge and empower the various capacities needed for transformations. Here we distinguish between different types of power that are important to governing sustainability transitions: innovative power, which fosters creation of new practices; reinforcive power, which has the capacity to sustain; and transformative power, which develops new institutions and structures. This allows for a governance culture that goes beyond ‘niche-regime’ power struggles, and instead facilitates more diverse and hybrid power dynamics that can challenge the status quo and overcome vested interest.

They occur within complex social-ecological systems and can be acted on in order to induce change. Interventions in leverage points can “unlock” undesirable feedbacks, and unleash the transformative potential of many interconnected systems to shift onto pathways for sustainability. Leverage points can be classified into deep and shallow ones (Abson et al. 2017). Interventions at deep leverage points have greater potential to change a system, while interventions at shallow leverage points may have minor influences (Chan et al. 2020). Therefore, the distinction between shallow and deep leverage points describes the extent to which interventions at these points can fundamentally alter the trajectory of a system and transform it. Following Abson et al.’s classification (2017), more shallow places to intervene include parameters and feedbacks. Deeper places to intervene include the designs and intents of a system, not least because changing system design and intent automatically has repercussions for feedbacks and parameters. However, because social-ecological systems are complex and adaptive, interventions can have unintended consequences, making it crucial to not just understand possible interventions at different levels of systemic depth, but also interactions among leverage points. These interactions describe how one type of change in a system might precipitate further changes across different systemic depths (i.e., parameters, feedbacks, design, intent) (Fischer and Riechers 2019). Changes in parameters could pave the way for a questioning of system goals and paradigms and vice versa. Hence, we can find sequences of how shallow to deep systemic changes flow on from and reinforce one another, creating coherent chains of leverage. Alterative chains of leverage can highlight mismatching or even conflicting elements (such as conflicting paradigms, rules, institutions) and highlight possibly more effective alternatives (Riechers et al. 2022).","1.

","In particular, the Transformation Flower Approach attends to multiple value creation and institutional change as a dual design challenge, and supports social contract formation at multiple levels (global to local) toward a new Natural Social Contract or Eco-Social Contract as actionable and positive visions, as described in chapter 2 of this assessment. This distinguishes the TFA from other transformative change approaches. By creating momentum for transformative innovation, the power of incumbents is reduced, as an important condition for achieving transformational change. Lock-in is encountered via path creation policies for promising innovations. The transformation flower approach (TFA) offers a framework for identifying interventions with stakeholders (participatory leverage point analysis) for achieving multiple value creation. Based on the notion of pathways, it provides a Theory of Change that aids in working towards desirable futures, involving both incumbents and challengers in an effort to harness untapped yet proximal potentials in a forward-looking way (Huntjens et al., 2023). Like transition management, the TFA accepts that policies should be adaptive, integrated and forward-looking and engaged with transformation pathways. The attention to multiple value creation and interdependent leverage points inserts greater reflexivity in processes of problem solving and governance, which thus far offer a weak stimulus to transformative change (because they are too much technology-focused). As described in Chapter 5 of this assessment, the Transformation Flower Approach helps to identify opportunities to link transformative options (the what), actors (the who) and levers (the how) in dynamic interaction to embark on transformative pathways (Huntjens et al., 2023).","Huntjens, P.; Rinscheid, A.; Kemp, R.; Van Helvoirt, B.; Aarts, N.; Visseren-Hamakers, I.; van Veen, A.; Hassink, J.

It is oriented at changing (sectoral) systems of production and consumption, through “guided processes of variation and selection, the outcomes of which act as stepping stones for further change” (Kemp et al., 2007). The underlying premise is that “a better understanding of the dynamics of complex, adaptive systems provides insight into the opportunities, limitations, and conditions under which it is possible to influence such systems” (Rotmans and Loorbach 2009). Examples of system innovation are: an energy system based on renewable energy, low-carbon transport (motorised and non-motorised) and regenerative agriculture based on agroecology. Such changes requires the nurturing of alternatives and pressures on regime-actors. Transition management seeks to make “the future more clearly manifest in current decisions, by adopting longer time frames, explore alternative trajectories (….) in critical societal subsystems”; foster collaborative networks for particular innovations and experiments with novel practices and technologies and allow “a diversity of innovations (’variation’) and competition among different approaches ( ’selection’) to fulfill societal needs” (Meadowcroft , 2009). The model of transition management was used by the Dutch government for promoting low-carbon energy innovation for a number of years (Kemp, 2010), but criticized for being functionalist and technocratic (democracy deficit), making too little use of environmental assessment, paying too little attention to distributional consequences & justice and acknowledging the (conflict-ridden) politics of policy design (Voβ et al., 2009).","Kemp, R., Loorbach, D., Rotmans, J.

",Metatheories of human action,"Many theories from across the social sciences and humanities aim to explain human action.  This large number of theories can be overwhelming and hard to navigate.  Yet this framework shows that this myriad of theories, at its foundation, is  represented by only eight sets of assumptions, or metatheories. Metatheories reflect the types of variables, timelines, scale of analysis, scale of change, levers, speed of implementation, and what types of changes each theory enables. Each of the eight metatheories  in this framework represents a unique perspective on human action; each is best suited for different action problems, and none are sufficient to address the full range of problems facing humanity today.  The synthetic understanding of human action enabled by this framework allows researchers and practitioners to determine which theory or theories may be most applicable for creating transformative change in a particular area.  Sustainability solutions may be most effective when they combine insights from multiple metatheories.  Nevertheless, most metatheories assume that many variables are static;  this widespread assumption prevents the inclusion of feedbacks and interdependent relationships that are crucial to systems analysis and sustainability. The `Interdependent Metatheory', which does account for these feedbacks, may thus be particularly important for understanding transformative change.

","Each of the eight metatheories implies a different cause of change.  Two metatheories focus on independent attributes of either 1) individuals or 2) structures.  Because they assume that most variables are constant, these first two metatheories may be relatively less useful for understanding the causes of tranformative change. Four metatheories focus on needs, including cognitive needs, psychological needs, communal needs, and economic needs.  The psychological needs metatheory may be particularly useful for creating sustainable changes, since satisfying psychological needs can lead to stable states. One metatheory examines often hidden, systemic factors. This metatheory may be key for unearthing the root causes of biodiversity loss, such as capitalism, speciesism, anthropocentrism, and particular socio-political systems. The last metatheory examines how multiple factors, and action itself, interact to cocreate a practice.  This metatheory is essential for navigating the transformative change process because it alone treats all variables as variable, and takes nothing for granted. This metatheory is thus key for avoiding surprise consequences of transformative change.  A crosscutting combination of these metatheories may present the clearest roadmap for how to transform towards sustainability. ","Shove, E. (2014).

Particular attention needs to be paid to the core values and principles, mindsets including attitudes and beliefs, and integrative approaches guiding significant transformative change, as well as the qualities, attributes, and relationships among change stewards that motivate such change (Bentz et al., 2022; Wamsler, 2020). To date, however, rather than linking to the necessary and likely catalytic rather than direct action processes involved in accomplishing systemic change, most of the literature, which is both conceptual and empirical, currently emphasizes: 1) the different types of transition that have taken place, labelled quantum leap, convergent, emergent, and gradual; 2) different transition pathways at different scales (multiple levels of analysis), including stability, four types of transition pathways (including, multilevel pathways, innovation strategies, diffusion of those innovations, and acceleration to enhance niche innovations), and a sequential process, and 3) overcoming a set of barriers to create enabling conditions for change (Fazey & Leicester, 2022). Initial stages of organizing for transformation include understanding the socioecological adaptive cycle (exploitation, conservation, release and reorganization) and providing different kinds of agency at the different phases of the cycle (Westley et al., 2013). It also means recognizing that there is still a significant need for fully process-based approaches that understand and implement processes that connect, cohere, and amplify the work of change agents (Waddock, 2023) to go well beyond ‘blah blah blah’ (Bentz et al., 2022) to engage and achieve purposeful transformation.

","Getting beyond the ‘blah, blah, blah’ of today’s understandings of system change (Bentz et al., 2022) means avoiding the risk that ‘transformation’ simply becomes another buzzword (Vogel & O’Brien, 2022). It requires moving theories of purposeful system transformation towards process-based approaches that help change stewards understand what to do, with whom, and how. Most current change frameworks and theories that emphasize: 1) types (descriptions) of system transformation, 2) pathways for how transition, mostly nonintentional, occurs, and 3) barriers and enabling conditions or agency of transformation (Fazey & Leicester, 2022). Even core archetypes oriented towards systemic change are prone to barriers and obstacles that prevent actual transformative impact, keeping the current system in place, making only incremental changes or failing (Fazey & Leicester, 2022). Purposeful systemic change demands that change stewards have significant process-based capabilities, including self-and system-awareness supporting wellbeing, agency, and strong social cohesion (Vogel & O’Brien, 2022; Westley et al., 2013), along with numerous capacities for both inner and outer change, including awareness, connection, insight, purpose, and agency (Wamsler et al., 2021). Because transformation is ‘deeply holistic, reflective, and relational’ (Vogel & O’Brien, 2022), it also requires holistic approaches and processes that are adaptable to multiple, always unique, socioecological contexts. Stewardship qualities needed include ‘seeing’ the system as a whole and acting on it as such and bringing actors into new action-oriented coalitions or networks that can work together and separately for greater impact (Westley et al., 2013). Key skills for catalyzing transformative change involve connecting and cohering relevant actors into new, aligned networks that co-emerge shared visions and knowledge, trust, and emerging social innovations by capitalizing on relevant windows of opportunity (Westley et al., 2013), and in amplification processes that involve actually mobilizing and implementing others to create change, yet these processes remain little studied (Waddock, 2023).

It challenges the duality between theory and practice or knowing and doing (Kilminster, 1979) and underlines that change occurs through ongoing dialectics between knowledge and practice. In the Marxist and Hegelian traditions, praxis included three main components: (1) actors’ critical consciousness; (2) actors’ mobilization; and (3) actors’ collective and multilateral action to reconstruct those social arrangements and themselves (Bernstein, 1971). Praxis challenges the idea that all change is predetermined by structural forces and emphasises that change is mutually constituted by the interplay of structure and agency as also elucidated in structuration theory, which unpacks how social order is produced, reproduced or subverted (Giddens 1984). Freire (2000), however, takes an emancipatory understanding of praxis and links it to self-conscious social actions. Thus, praxis is an embedded, reflexive and engaged process of change aimed towards the transformation of the self and the wider social and institutional arrangements, in an attempt to reconfigure the dominant development trajectory (Seo and Creed 2002; O’Brien and Sygna 2013; Mehta et al. 2021). The individual is a partially autonomous actor imbued with an agency to change (through contestations, alliance building, etc.) but also constrained by structural forces that prevent action/maintain the status quo. Human praxis presupposes a change in social arrangement or their reconstruction through the agency of individuals. It mediates between social contradictions (produced as an outcome of development processes) which can potentially play a fundamental role in driving change (Seo & Creed, 2002). Key to transformative praxis is a better understanding of how the agency can be strengthened to bring about structural alterations and consequently inform wider societal changes. In this respect, it can be explored as the capability to change (Sen 2001) linked to values of justice, and equity. ","Freire, P. (2000) Pedagogy of the Oppressed. London: Bloomsbury Publishing.

In several contexts, biodiversity loss is induced/exacerbated by top-down and aggressive neoliberal practices that have marginalised vulnerable populations through dispossession, loss of habitats, identity and well-being producing contradictions across scales, especially at the local level. Human agency is central to responses to environmental change and crises (Brown and Westaway 2011) and constitutes the personal sphere through which transformations can be motivated (O’Brien and Sygna 2013). Thus, it is important to engage with how and whether practices of coproducing socio-ecological knowledge (on agriculture, livestock, livelihoods and ecosystem conservation) can enhance the agency of people to transform existing socio-political structures of power and recognition (Mehta et al. 2021). In these contexts, deliberate/intentional transformative initiatives can serve to counter entrenched injustices and political exclusion in current systems of knowledge-making, governance and valuation (Burke and Heynan 2014). While focus through specific initiatives can facilitate transformative pathways, scaling up often meets with various challenges because of structural factors such as systemic power, knowledge politics and incumbent agency. This contradiction can lead to new alliances - across classes and categories of people, species, knowledge groups as well as relations of power and dominance- which can scan for windows of opportunity to push for change. Such alliances and their initiatives serve as ‘seeds’ or ‘socio-ecological bright spots’ that can improve environmental conditions and human well-being (Bennet et al 2016). Intentional transformative change requires bottom-up processes which centre the agency and voice of communities that are most affected by the climate and biodiversity crisis. It is not linear and is layered with multiple alignments and contradictions. Local level solidarities can emerge in the process which lift hidden perspectives and invisible voices (of women, children and young people) but if done hastily, these can lead to the reproduction of dominant voices and inequalities revealing the dark side of transformation (Blythe et al. 2018).

The pathways have a theoretical basis in Kellert’s (1993) nine values of biophilia. Through ascertaining engagement with and perceived importance of each of the nine values, five types of activity associated with nature connectedness were identified. These were contact through the senses, emotional engagement, noticing nature’s beauty, finding meaning in nature and acting with compassion towards nature. The pathways can be used to inform the design of new initiatives to improve human–nature relationships or used as a lens to review existing initiatives. The pathways framework encourages specific types of active engagement, moving away from traditional human-nature relationships of utility, control and knowledge that have dominated the human relationship with the rest of the natural world and thus contributed to a failing relationship with nature and the environmental crises.","Lumber, R., Richardson, M., & Sheffield, D.

Firstly, research shows and robust and likely causal relationship between increased nature connectedness and pro-environmental behaviours (Mackay and Schmitt, 2019). With this including pro-nature conservation behaviours (Richardson et al. 2020a). The pathways can be applied across a range of leverage points relevant across multiple societal scales (Richardson et al, 2020b; Meadows, 1999).

27,,iago.otero@unil.ch ,Iago Otero,"Interdisciplinary Centre for Mountain Research, University of Lausanne",Political ecology,"Political ecology combines the concerns of ecology and a broadly defined political economy (Blaikie & Brookfield, 1987). Political ecology approaches social-ecological change through the lens of metabolic production whereby societies constantly metabolize nature, producing new socionatures (Swyngedouw, 2004). Society and nature are not considered antithetical entities but are intertwined in a relational perspective. A central analytical focus of political ecological research is how uneven power relationships manifest in uneven distributions of the costs and benefits of social-ecological change across social groups, class, race, gender, or region (Martinez-Alier, 2002). These uneven power relationships, together with a growing metabolism under capitalism, are considered to create ecological distribution conflicts (Temper et al., 2018). Such conflicts arise when environmental damage affects communities, who mobilize to either prevent it or to recoup the losses stemming from it. Ecological distribution conflicts are studied as symptoms of an unsustainable development model and as proof of the existence of conflicting visions around what constitutes a good life (Temper et al., 2018). This relates to another crucial theoretical and analytical standpoint of political ecology, namely that in any society there is an irreducible antagonism for alternative futures and forms of power distribution (Mouffe, 2005). This insight is encapsulated in the adjective political, which stands in contrast to apolitical ecologies that attribute environmental problems to a range of causes - biophysical or social - beyond the realm of collective choice. Political ecology thus aspires to politicize public debates and choices about desired socionatures and the necessary transformative changes to produce them.","Blaikie, P., Brookfield, H. 1987.

","Political ecological research asks how intentional transformative change (TC) unfolds on the ground, which actors promote or resist it, and how it is able (or not) to counteract the underlying causes of unsustainability (Otero and Nielsen, 2017). In so doing, political ecology shifts attention from purely technical, managerial and governance solutions to the political, institutional, and cultural conditions facilitating or preventing the production of sustainable socionatures. It is used to better understand the underlying drivers of biodiversity loss - mostly the expansion of capitalist social-ecological relationships - and to emphasize the need to transform these relationships in a democratic and sustainable way (Pichler et al., 2017). Together with other critical social theories, it can shed light on how to unmake capitalist relationships to facilitate the emergence of post-capitalist ones (Feola et al., 2021). Lawhon and Murphy (2012) identified four main contributions of political ecology to generating and navigating TC: reconsidering how and by whom an environmental problem is defined; considering a broader range of legitimate actors and knowledges; addressing power as embedded in relations and structures; and anticipating negative consequences of TC (e.g., inequality). Actors intentionally triggering TC include: environmental justice movements active against environmental damages, agroecological farmers and food sovereignty networks, social movements like feminism or degrowth, activists against infrastructure or fossil energy expansion, some public agencies, etc. Through their alternative practices and visions in the making, these actors address direct (e.g., land-use changes, climate change, pollution) and indirect (e.g., economy, values) drivers of biodiversity loss.

These spaces are created through transdisciplinary and action-oriented approaches that entail co-production focusing on participants' interactions to promote desired changes. As these deliberate endeavours aim to create conditions for change towards more sustainable pathways (in terms of legitimate, just, inclusive, and democratic), it is essential to understand how such interventions may enable transformative change (Chambers et al. 2022). 
 
Transformative spaces are safe-enough collaborative settings where change agents working in transformation can experiment with new notions, framings, and practices that might help in shifting social-ecological systems onto alternative pathways (Pereira et al. 2018). These processes actively seek to bring into dialogue different actors, with their own experiences, expertise and affections regarding a social-ecological problem or challenge (Drimie et al. 2018). Transformative spaces also enable reflection and reflexive learning, while reframing issues in ways that allow solutions to be co-created and co-implemented (Pereira et al. 2020). For this to be achieved, several transformative spaces seek a configuration of actors that is not diverse in terms of sectors, but diverse in terms of the participants’ experiences. Such diversity might enable, together with a safe-enough atmosphere that is attentive to power asymmetries, to challenge the status quo if collectively perceived as unjust or not sustainable.

Transformative spaces take different formats and are informed by distinct rationales because they are context-dependent (Asenbaum & Hanusch 2021). Some of these have been inspired by the notion of ‘laboratory’, as a space for collaborative experimentation aimed at tackling complex social and environmental challenges (e.g., Transition labs, Change labs, Social Innovation labs). In particular, the Transformation Laboratories (T-Lab) approach has as its main goal to co-create a space where participants can test multiple solutions or strategies for change, which together could address a social-ecological challenge.

The T-Lab approach identifies six conditions to convene such a process: a dominant social-ecological situation to be challenged, dissension over the issue, unsuccessful experiments with alternative solutions, collective awareness of urgency for change, identification of an opportunity for transformation, and the presence of a convener with significant ownership over the issue and strong motivation to help enable participants' agency (Pereira et al. 2021).

Transformative spaces enable novel reconnections between actors and their environment through reframing. Reframing allows actors to identify new ways of acting in the system based on their own expertise. Capacities, knowledges, and skills of participants are explored to find new points and possibilities for action that are meaningful for all involved. Reframing might also entail questioning and challenging internal and external power relations and dominant narratives to rethink new forms of social-ecological organisation (Marshall et al. 2021). This implies implementing assemblages of diverse methodological frameworks and tools that are both context-based and attractive to maintain participants’ engagement.

Reframing is central to this approach as it promotes the development of the actors' sense of agency, a critical ingredient in transformations (Charli-Joseph et al. 2022). Transformative spaces promote an increasing sense of agency where it appears to be lacking, particularly in actors and/or communities historically oppressed or silenced by groups with more power (Marshall et al. 2018; Temper et al. 2018). Reframing situates actors as part of the system and encourages a new re-appropriation of the system where interdependent relationships become more explicit. Interdependent relationships lead to a relational view of the world, which is crucial to recognize deeper causes of biodiversity loss, include the more-than-human in the circle of concern, and propose strategies that include the diversity of living forms and ways of being in transformative decision-making.","1.

29,VIA MAIL 24.10.2023,karen.obrien@sosgeo.uio.no,Karen O'Brien,,Three Spheres of Transformation,"Transformations to an equitable and sustainable world occurs through simultaneous and interrelated changes in form, structure, and meaning-making. These three interconnected dimensions constitute the three spheres of transformation, referred to as the practical, political, and personal spheres (O'Brien, 2018). The practical sphere focuses on actions and interventions that contribute directly to measurable outcomes and tends to emphasize technical and behavioral approaches to change that are aligned with objectives and goals, such as the 23 targets of the Global Biodiversity Framework. The political sphere refers to the structures and systems that influence or govern how society is organized. This includes the social and cultural norms, rules, regulations, and institutions that reflect the values that are prioritized and the goals that are pursued. They also influence how solutions are negotiated, decided, and implemented, and by whom, recognizing conflicting interests, power differences, and the impact of social movements. The personal sphere refers to individual and shared beliefs, values, worldviews, and paradigms that influence how people perceive, define, or constitute systems and structures, and how they relate to each other and to nature. The description of the three spheres as separate distinguishes the different dimensions, but in reality they are always integrated. Transformative potential is seldom realized when attention to any single sphere is ignored. For example, a focus on the practical sphere alone often overlooks the social, cultural, and political dimensions of change in the political sphere, such as power dynamics within economic, political, and socio-ecological systems, and the diversity of beliefs, values, and worldviews in the personal sphere that influence these dynamics (O’Brien and Sygna, 2013). By addressing the three spheres simultaneously, actors can identify the practical outcomes that are desired, the political barriers to transformation, and opportunities to collaborate and strategically design and develop strategies to overcome them by connecting with the personal sphere. The three spheres of transformation focus on developing processes and patterns that shift systems and cultures across scales, recognizing the power and potential of individuals and groups to contribute to change across multiple spheres of influence.

","The three spheres of transformation framework is based on a “conscious full spectrum response” model developed by Dr. Monica Sharma and tested in over 60 countries (Sharma 2017). This is a framework for both understanding and action, with the goal of generating shifts in systems and cultures to produce measurable results. It is a framework for action that recognizes the role of individual and collective agency in systems change. However, rather than perceiving individuals as objects to be changed in the name of a particular goal, this approach recognizes that all individuals, regardless of their position, rank, role, experience, or authority, possess the capacity to lead transformations, often in partnership with communities, groups and governments (Sharma, 2017; O’Brien, 2021; Thiermann and Sheate, 2020). Strategic action is not confined to the upper tiers of hierarchies in politics, business, or organizations, or ascribed to an abstract concept of social movements; rather, it includes the individuals and groups who have courage and capacities to overcome fragmented approaches and to  do things differently. Individual agency, collective agency, and political agency is particularly effective when grounded in universal values that apply to all, such as equity, justice, and dignity (Sharma 2017; O’Brien et al. 2022).   

Acknowledging the multifaceted nature of transformation, a central challenge lies in creating an enabling environment for individuals and groups to engage comprehensively with all three transformation spheres. In the personal sphere, transformation results when individuals and organizations feel empowered to engage in shifting structures and systems in their spheres of influence, and to create optimal conditions for generating practical results across all scales. Transformative change also involves reflecting on the collective values that reinforce the root causes of biodiversity loss, including those that underpin actions in everyday life, work and projects. In the political sphere, transformative change involves identifying specific barriers to change and being clear about which existing systems maintain the status quo, and what specifically needs to shift. Promoting cultural and systemic changes and their practical manifestations involves the strategic design and implementation of projects, policies, and plans based on what matters deeply to all actors. The Three Spheres framework emphasizes the importance of each actor’s quality of agency; it recognizes that how people show up makes a difference to processes of transformative change (O'Brien et al., 2023).

30,10/09/2023 12:19:14,fikret.adaman@gmail.com,Fikret Adaman,"Economics Department, Boğaziçi University",Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation,"In his The Great Transformation Karl Polanyi (1944/1957) argued that when an expanding “self-regulating” market (read as a laisser-faire capitalist) economy takes hold, land (nature), labour and money would become “fictitious commodities”, leading the separation of the economy from society and nature—in his parlance the “first movement”. Pushed to its extreme, this separation could not only ruin societal life but also destroy the entire ecological system. Polanyi distinguishes between regular markets, where goods and services are exchanged, and the self-regulating market system, which treats inputs of production as if they were commodities. This institutionalization of land (nature), labour and money as commodities is seen by Polanyi as a defining characteristic of capitalism (Dale, 2016; Devine 2019). To the extent that the economy becomes a separate and distinct sphere, it would transform all relational aspects into mere cost-and-benefit accounting (Madra and Adaman, 2014). As such, The Great Transformation, in addition to being a fascinating economic history book on capitalism, can equally be seen as a critic of neoliberalism avant la letter (Adaman, 2017).

Despite these consequences, Polanyi believes that the destruction he describes would never fully occur because the first movement would inevitably trigger a counter-movement of self-protection. This “double movement” would involve humanity re-establishing the integration of the economy into society and nature, thus regulating conditions favourable to market expansion. The tension between market logic and society’s efforts to protect itself from the outcomes of that logic will always exist; and as long as the economy remains detached, humanity cannot establish its dominance. Polanyi calls for a system where the market is no longer self-regulating, even in principle, as it would no longer encompass labour, land, and money.

","In his book The Great Transformation, Polanyi described the shift from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society in early nineteenth century England. However, he also advocated for a further transformation to a post-capitalist system, where society would have control over the economy instead of the economy controlling society and nature. Polanyi observed that societies would attempt to embed the economy back into society and nature, but acknowledged that these efforts might well take reactionary forms. Bolshevism and Fascism in the first half of the twentieth century were seen by Polanyi as alternative ways to limit the destructive consequences of unregulated capitalism, although they came at significant societal and ecological costs. Instead, Polanyi supported a form of associational socialism that aimed to consciously subordinate the self-regulating market to a democratic society: “Socialism is, essentially, the tendency inherent in an industrial civilization to transcend the self-regulating market by consciously subordinating it to a democratic society” (Polanyi, 1944/1957: 234; Devine, 2019). His earlier writings from around 1920 provide more details about his preferred economic organizational structure (Brie and Thomasberger, 2018; Adaman and Devine, 2022).

In his influential work, Polanyi focused primarily on nation-states and, to a lesser extent, the global monetary system as the key actors responsible for taking actions (“double movement”) to control the expansion of market forces. However, he did not explicitly explore the potential actions that could be taken at different scales, such as at the local level. More recent literature has expanded on and broadened Polanyi’s vision to incorporate different scales (local, national, and global) in today’s world (Adaman, 2017).

Marxist theory is a theoretical framework for understanding modern capitalist societies and their historicity that builds on Karl Marx’s critique of the political economy of his time which he published in Das Kapital and his lifelong work. Marxist theory is concerned with understanding the exploitation of wage workers, with understanding value creation and with deciphering the dynamic of capital accumulation that is a motor of capitalist societies. Marxist theory today has been developed further and broadened, to incorporate e. g. feminism and gender issues (Federici 2012), to account for racial inequality (Robinson 2019) and to incorporate more clearly analyses of the metabolism between society and nature (Foster 1999). While Marx has not specifically dealt with the problem of biodiversity loss, the environment is present in his original work, especially in his concept of ecological crises that originate from a metabolic rift in pre-capitalist society-nature-metabolisms created by industrial capitalism. Political economic research is only just beginning to address the problem of biodiversity loss and policies for protecting biodiversity from a political economic perspective (e. g. Ghosh 2015). Yet, according to Marxist theory, the capitalist organization of the economy is a root cause of biodiversity loss since capitalist profit making requires the production of environmental externalities (Saave 2023), such as biodiversity loss or global warming.

","Intentional transformative change in Marxist theory 
People have derived from Marxist theory many different clues for how intentional transformative change should occur, including large projects such as socialist revolution or smaller scale strategies that involve commoning or autonomous organization. Marx himself envisioned to provide the working class with knowledge about how this class is exploited under capitalism, which would inspire a class consciousness and result in workers reclaiming the means of production and reclaiming power to organize the economy in non-exploitative ways. This change is intentional because it is assumed that the working class intentionally takes control over the production process. With the broadening of Marxist theory, this understanding of change has been broadened as well. It now includes commoning, for example of resources and care responsibilities, which is a strategy inspired by materialist feminism (Dalla Costa and James 1973). Intentional change also includes degrowing the economy as an antidote to continued capital accumulation and resource use, which inspired by the anti-capitalist strands of the degrowth movement (Schmelzer, Vetter and Vansintjan 2022). Ecologically oriented Marxist thinkers today also call for stopping extractivist profit making (Svampa 2015) that deteriorates ecosystems worldwide but most importantly in capitalist peripheries, thereby contributing to the colonial continuities in the appropriation of nature. The broadening of Marxist theory has led the focus away from solely paying attention to the working class as actors of intentional change and getting into view also unpaid workers, e.g. in the household and in peasant economies (Mies 1986). Feminist materialist thinkers have significantly contributed to Marxist understandings of intentional change that go beyond the sphere of production, thus including reproduction and the actors responsible for upholding reproductivity, both with regards to humans and nature (Barca 2020).

Most economic valuation studies and environmental assessments assume that a transformation or a change regarding an environmental outcome can happen if the rationality principle is fulfilled. For instance, according to the Coase theorem, bargaining and negotiation will lead to an efficient outcome in solving the problem of market externalities in the case of low transaction costs. Negotiation is supposed to take place on terms that accurately reflect the full costs and under perfect information and equal market power amongst the parties. The theorem is proposed as a solution to transform negative externalities into positive externalities. However, relevant literature suggests that in many decision-making processes, factors such as cognitive limitations, behavioural biases, and distribution of decision-making over actors and in time play an important role in transformation as well (Kørnøv and Thissen, 2012).","Pouta E., Rekola M., Kuuluvainen J., Li C-Z., Tahvonen O.

This interdisciplinary field, primarily advanced by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues, delves into the intricate web of rules, norms, and shared strategies that mold human behaviors (Ostrom, 2009). 

Central to institutional analysis is its challenge to the conventional wisdom that governance solutions can be solely derived from the state or market. The groundbreaking work of Elinor Ostrom and her collaborators revealed a richness in the diverse institutions that co-evolved to successfully govern common-pool resources. Moving beyond conventional approaches towards community-based and polycentric institutions have played a crucial role in fostering sustainable resource management practices, and especially in shifting power toward local and/or historically marginalized communities (Nagendra and Ostrom, 2012).

At the core of institutional analysis lies the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework, which serves as a cornerstone of this field. This framework provides a conceptual structure for comprehending the generation of rules, norms, and shared strategies and how they exert influence over human decision-making within specific action arenas (Ostrom, 2009). 

A pivotal concept within institutional analysis is polycentric governance, which encompasses a complex interplay of entities, including governments and non-governmental organizations, in the creation and maintenance of institutions (Morrison et al. 2023). Although sometimes employing a polycentric lens, empirical institutional literature infrequently considered multiple levels dimensions with the richest case studies focused on the community levels. Contemporary institutional biodiversity research has shifted to multi-level institutional analyses that focus on the local to international. This evolution provides a more holistic understanding of governance structures necessary to transform for the current biodiversity challenges. 

Institutional analysts' examination of rules, norms, and shared strategies, alongside exploration of institutional change within multi-level and polycentric governance systems provides a foundation for understanding how to shape human behavior and more sustainably govern biodiversity (Dietz et al. 2003).","Cumming, G.

","Intentional transformative change, viewed through an institutional lens, manifests through several critical mechanisms. Key to this process is ""institutional navigation,"" whereby actors maneuver through existing institutional landscapes to shape governance systems and drive change (Lubell and Morrison, 2021). This navigation includes adapting to, co-learning with, and co-producing institutions that are more responsive to the needs and preferences of relevant communities and constituencies (Wyborn, 2015). 

Institutional scholarship also must address epistemic diversity, procedural justice, and recognitional justice to facilitate novel governance arrangements that foster more just, sustainable, and equitable systems (York & Yazar, 2022). Historically marginalized communities and peoples with diverse knowledge systems and priorities have been absent, systematically excluded, from biodiversity governance structures - in turn reproducing inequity and also fueling biodiversity loss.

In the context of biodiversity conservation, institutional analysis provides insights into the root human causes of biodiversity challenges and offers potential pathways that facilitate institutional change through collective action and environmental justice. The path to intentional transformative change within biodiversity governance requires acknowledging historical exclusions and striving for meaningful inclusivity. This transformation seeks to incorporate individuals who have been marginalized, broadening the scope of biodiversity governance discussions to include diverse preferences, knowledge systems, and approaches. In doing so, it challenges and redefines the very concept of biodiversity itself (Kashwan et al., 2021).

Recognizing and addressing power imbalances and injustices within governance, particularly concerning recognition and procedural justice (York & Yazar, 2022), are pivotal steps in addressing pressing biodiversity concerns. Transformation also emphasizes the need to question the dominant global economic system in order to examine alternative approaches to biodiversity management (Kashwan et al., 2021).

The Inuit Circumpolar Council's shift toward food sovereignty, self-governance, and rejection (for example) of single-species management, underscores the potential of localized, multi-level approaches that transcend traditional harvest management appraoches (Inuit Circumpolar Council - Alaska, 2020). Ultimately, intentional transformative change requires redesigning institutions, confronting power asymmetry, and addressing injustice.

Its root lies in ancient Chinese Taoist philosiphy of the “Unity of Man and Nature”. It advocates the harmonious relationships between socioeconomic development and environmental protections, including biodiversity conservation  (Ma et al., 2021). It evolves from philosophical and academic concepts to practical endeavours, especially after 2007 when it became the fundemantal framework to build a moderately prosperous society in China (Xue et al., 2023). It manifests in various ways including developing environmental laws and policies, encouraging green technological innovations,protecting natural ecosystems and conserving biodiveristy, as well as involving multiple stakeholders in decision making (IPBES, 2019; Ma and Wei, 2021). Under the umbrella of the framework, the ideas of “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets” and “mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass, and deserts are a community of life” are proposed to foster ecological civilization constructions (e.g., the 125 local pilots Geall and Ely, 2018).

An important national level practice is the Ecological Redline Policy (Jiang et al., 2019) which establish regulatory targets at the landscape level in a spatially explicit way to protect ecosystem functions and their services to people. A series of initiatives and plans were fomulated, such as national park establishment, main fuction-oriented zoning, and nature reserve conservation, in light of ecological civilization framework. These policies and plans play critical roles in attainments of various sustainable development goals, such as poverty reduction, environmental protection, safeguarding ecological integrity and improving human health (Bryan et al., 2019). Another nationwide practice is the establishement of eco-civilization constrcution demonstration zones. It is reported that during 2017 and 2022, 462 zones and 187 practical innovation bases were approved in China (Zhang and Fu, 2023). Some of these zones focus on ecological restoration and improving livelihood of local residents, e.g., the Loess Plateau (Fu et al., 2017). Some emphasize the “end-of-pipe” treatment of environmental pollution, such as “Dongguan pollution treatment model” (Xue et al., 2023). Some are dedicated to develop natural resource products, eco-industrialization, and eco-tourism (Xue et al., 2023). Some explore technical innovations, especially in terms of improving resource efficiency and reducing waste charges. For these demonstration zones, a new metric system for evaluating the performance of local officers is developed, and a “chief executive accountability system” is developed to manage natura resources in an integrated and coordinated way (Gu et al., 2020). It is noting that these policies, plans and demonstrations evolve in an adaptive and iterative way, and they may generate diverse benefits for sustainable development goals and biodiversity conservation.

He refers to the exercise of government as “governmentality”. Environmental social scientists have developed Foucault’s ideas of government and governmentality to understand the various ways through which pro-environmental behaviours are shaped. By combining governmentality with environmental governance–referred to as “environmentality”– Agrawal (2005) and others use governmentality to examine how technologies of government produce “environmental subjects” (West 2006, Dressler, 2014). Critical political ecologists relate environmental governmentality with the neoliberalization of environmental regulation, developing the concepts of “green governmentality” (Rutherford, 2011) and “neoliberal governmentality” (Fletcher, 2010). They argue that recent market-based environmental schemes such as payment for ecosystem services (PES), ecotourism, and carbon offsetting are designed to promote market-centred understandings of nature and consumption-based environmental behaviours.

","Governmentality serves as an analytical tool for examining the creation and operation of environmental governance. From a governmentality perspective, the regime of governance consists of programs, strategies, and subjects. The practice of government requires specific “programs” (e.g., ecotourism, PES) that aim to transform human behaviours. These programs are mediated through an array of “technologies of intervention” including sovereign (e.g., rules, penalties), disciplinary (e.g., norms), and regulatory mechanisms. The practice of governmentality then produces “environmental subjects” who are willing to think and act in accordance with the mentality of government. 

Recent studies on governmentality draw attention to the complex operation of power in governmentalities, which diversifies the forms and processes of environmental governmentality projects in practice. Fletcher (2017) identifies the simultaneous operation of multiple forms of governmentalities–sovereign, disciplinary, neoliberal, and truth forms of governmentality–within the same mode of environmental governance, which he refers to as “multiple governmentalities”. Others are concerned with the site-specific historical, political, and social conditions under which governmentalities are being operated (Roth and Dressler, 2012, Fletcher and Breitling, 2012, Dressler, 2014; Bluwstein, 2017; Choi 2021). These authors are particularly interested in identifying various, and sometimes unanticipated, changes to the intervening strategies and subject positions, not all of which neatly aligne with the plan of the governors. This renewed thinking of governmentalities as situated and variegated processes provides a useful framework for understanding and designing biodiversity-related environmental governance for transformative changes.

Hinton,Lund University,Degrowth and Post-growth Studies,"A sustainable society equitably meets everybody’s needs within the ecological limits of the planet. Economic growth (i.e., GDP growth) has become a central goal and measure of success for societies around the world. However, economic growth has been driving biodiversity loss and climate change, because all economic activity requires energy and materials and results in some amount of pollution. There is no evidence that economic growth can be sufficiently decoupled from environmental pressures. Furthermore, the last few decades of global economic growth has left the poor in poverty and made the rich richer.  Thus, addressing today’s social and environmental crises requires fundamental changes to socio-economic systems, to equitably meet needs without economic growth. This entails re-orienting societal goals away from economic growth to material sufficiency.  Communities that are currently overconsuming need to reduce their consumption so that deprived communities can increase their consumption to a level of sufficiency.

Degrowth scholarship and degrowth policy recommendations are diverse. However, there is a high level of consensus on the following aspects. Policies should shift from focusing on GDP to focus instead on public health indicators (incl. ecological functioning). An increased sharing and swapping of existing resources can meet more needs with less impact. Production, consumption, and work should decrease. Accordingly, businesses and markets must shift away from for-profit structures. For-profit markets tend to drive overconsumption, growth, inequality, market concentration, and political capture, because their legal purpose is to enrich private owners. Instead, not-for-profit businesses and markets can complement community provisioning, because they treat profit only as a means to achieve social benefit. All of this can result in society’s limited resources (including the surplus) going to where they are needed most, rather than accumulating in the hands of the wealthy. This can increase the quality of life for most people within ecological limits.","Hickel, J., 2019. Degrowth: A Theory of Radical Abundance. real-world economics review 54–68.

","Degrowth scholarship encompasses a range of theories and frameworks of how intentional transformative change occurs. One approach is a synthesis of institutional theory and systems thinking. Institutions are broadly defined as social rules. Institutional theory describes how formal institutions (e.g., laws, property rights, contracts) and informal institutions (e.g., beliefs, norms, logics) influence each other over time, by either reinforcing or undermining the other to some degree. Both formal and informal institutions shape actors’ behavior, by guiding and constraining their behavior. (An actor can be an individual or a group of people, like an organization.) Actors, in turn, can shape the institutions around them, by accommodating, resisting, or changing these social rules. It is through this triad of actors’ agency, formal institutions, and informal institutions that societies change over time. A systems thinking lens enhances this understanding of transformative change by identifying key feedback loops that are either keeping the system structure in place or creating opportunities for change (e.g., leverage points). When key institutions in society begin to contradict each other (institutional misalignment), there are opportunities for intentional change. For instance, when society’s values increasingly support environmental protection but policy goals and legal frameworks still encourage overconsumption, the resulting tension creates the space for transformative degrowth actions. 

Policy-makers can shift from monetary goals to social and ecological ones (e.g., Happy Planet Index, public health indexes). They can redistribute wealth via taxes and reparations. They can implement a shorter work week. They can shift subsidies, tax benefits, public procurement, and seed-funding away from for-profit organizations to the social economy (e.g., social enterprises, consumer cooperatives, foundation-owned businesses, etc.).

Citizens can identify the social economy around them and shift their consumption accordingly. They can create networks of sharing and swapping to maximize the use of existing goods.

For-profit companies can shift to not-for-profit legal structures (e.g., Patagonia, Steward Ownership).

Not-for-profit companies can focus more on ecological impacts (e.g., Saltå Kvarn, Blue Star Recyclers).

Social movements (incl. social justice and environmental) can collaborate to raise awareness and push for the above-actions (e.g., Degrowth Movement, Wellbeing Economy Alliance) and hold leaders accountable for implementing the above actions.","Hinton, J.B., 2021.

It addresses the most enduring challenges, such as equity and equality, and calls for a redefinition of the purposes and content of education for the 21st century. TE seeks to ensure the right to quality education throughout life, as a public endeavor and a common good, providing learners support to learn to learn, learn to live together, learn to do, and learn to be (United Nations, 2022). Within this framework, TE strives to articulate a vision that prepares individuals of all ages to address profound socio-environmental crises and challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, poverty, and inequality (O'Brien et al., 2013; United Nations, 2022). 
TE promotes knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes for effective problem-solving, empathy, creative thinking, and critical thinking to thrive in an ever-changing world (Graham & Longchamps, 2022). To achieve this, TE is grounded in pedagogical principles and didactic approaches that prioritize several key elements (Graham & Longchamps, 2022): sustainable learning (focusing on the in-depth knowledge and skills in the long term), learner-centeredness (Schweisfurth, 2013), active learning, embodied cognition, integrative teaching methods (ranging from interdisciplinarity to multidisciplinarity and holistic learning), and STEAM education (Marín-Marín et al., 2021).
Furthermore, TE contributes to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is an integral part of the SDG Targets on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED) (United Nations, 2022). As a result, TE often intersects with Environmental Education (EE), ESD, and Education for a Sustainable Future (ESF) (O'Brien et al., 2013). Education systems must establish the essential prerequisites for transformative education, including adequate investment and the active involvement of educators, among others (United Nations, 2022).","-Graham, C., & Longchamps, P.

Educate sustainably: by prioritizing concepts and theories over raw facts and data, and by engaging in meaningful and authentic activities that enhance long-term memory.
Learner-centered practice: it entails a departure from subject- or teacher-centered methods, emphasizing the central role of students in education. It involves offering hands-on experiences where learners wield a substantial degree of active control over both the content and the learning process (Schweisfurth, 2013).
Active learning: involves the active and constructive engagement of learners in mindful and culturally relevant tasks. This approach fosters social and cognitive involvement, facilitating a progressive integration between the individuals’ operations and the elements coming from the experience with the environment (Vosniadou, 2001).
Embodied cognition can be seen as an approach that encourages physical and tangible (including virtual) interactions within the physical and social learning environment. It is closely associated with hands-on activities (Abrahamson & Lindgren, 2014).
Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches: promote an open, non-linear, situated, and heterogeneous perspective on knowledge and social-ecological systems (O’Brien et al., 2013).
STEAM: an educational project-based approach that stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), which has more recently been accompanied by the ‘A’  (Arts) in order to improve creativity and integrate cognitive and affective domains of learning.
Expected Transformative Learning (TL) could be characterized as a co-creative process through which prior beliefs, assumptions, and taken-for-granted perspectives on oneself, relationships, and society are critically examined to evolve into more open, creative, adaptable, and well-validated viewpoints, values, and social practices (Cranton & Carusetta, 2004). Dialogue serves as a means and the primary material for co-constructing and achieving a shared understanding.

38,21/10/2023 00:27:59,aarti.gupta@wur.nl,Aarti Gupta,"Professor of global environmental governance, Wageningen University, the Netherlands",Strengthening Accountability Frameworks,"Broadly understood, accountability entails giving an account of one’s actions or being answerable for one’s actions and behaviors (Boven 2007, 2010). Accountability is fundamentally a relational concept: one set of actors is accountable to another for adhering to an agreed standard of behavior. This also requires a judgement about whether the standard of behavior is being met, and sanctions or penalties for non-adherence. Only when each of these elements are present can a relationship of accountability be said to exist. Thus, both the concept and actual practice of accountability can be broken down into four elements: (1) a relational element, linking those who are held accountable to those who have the right to hold to account; (2) a normative element, that is, a standard of behavioral defined with sufficient precision; (3) a decision element, that is, a judgment by those holding others to account about whether an expected standard of behavior has been met; and (4) a behavioral element that allows the account-holder to sanction non-adherence to the standard by those being held accountable. All four elements are required to secure meaningful accountability of key actors, both public and private, in order to further desired sustainability transformations (Biermann and Gupta 2011). Furthermore, transformative change requires that a diverse array of public and private actors need to be accountable to each other for their sustainability performance or non-performance. This need for accountability permeates all levels of sustainability governance, from the local to the global. It includes a need for accountability of public regulation and authorities, as well as novel types of private governance arrangements within and beyond the nation state.","Biermann, Frank and Gupta, Aarti. 2011.

","In operationalizing meaningful accountability relationships as a key means to fuel transformative change, an important question is how to secure the consent of those who are to be held accountable, and who has the right to hold whom to account. This is a crucial test for the possibility to realize transformative change, and is related to an important distinction between what Keohane (2006) calls internal and external accountability. In internal accountability, those holding to account and those to be held accountable are institutionally linked to each other, making this form of accountability relatively easier to secure than external accountability, where those impacted by the behaviors of others they may wish to hold accountable may not be directly (or institutionally) linked. 

Another important element of accountability relationships—and an oft-assumed precondition for accountability relationships to drive transformative change—is the transparency of sustainability governance processes and outcomes (Fox 2007, Hood 2010). Transparency is widely assumed to be critically important to securing more accountability, yet this requires that such transparency shine a light on those most responsible for unsustainable outcomes. Thus, transparency can only further accountability if information disclosure is actionable and meaningful, and does not place further burden on, or seek to control, those already disenfranchised (Gupta and Mason 2014, Gupta and van Asselt 2019).
 
Finally, accountability is also a core element of deliberative democracy, which focuses on questions of inclusion and exclusion in transformation processes (Lehtonen 2005). Who decides who is to be included in diverse processes of transformative change, especially those designed to further accountability of key actors? Designing meaningful forms of accountability that operationalize all four key pillars of the accountability relationship in practice is crucial to realizing transformative change, especially given the vast discrepancies of wealth and power that currently drive unsustainable behaviors (Park and Kramarz 2019).","Bovens, Marks. 2010.

BPI aims to avoid or at least mitigate trade-offs between biodiversity and sectoral objectives and to promote synergies (think of approaches such as eco-engineering, nature-based solutions, building with nature, and agroecology; Persson et al., 2018). 
BPI literature is relatively young (the bulk of scientific papers has been published in the last decade) and still little scientific research has been conducted on assessing and explaining outcomes of BPI processes (e.g., the implementation of sector-specific policies to promote biodiversity and the subsequent revision of practices), let alone on impacts (on biodiversity recovery)(Huntley, 2014; Runhaar et al., 2023, forthcoming). The few available studies suggest BPI in practice is hard to achieve and thus only modestly contributes to biodiversity protection due to competition between biodiversity targets and sectoral goals and the non-binding character of sectoral commitments to biodiversity recovery (e.g., Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018). This is in line with the wider literature on Environmental Policy Integration (EPI)(Runhaar et al., 2020).","Huntley, B.J.

Examples of driving forces include high-input/high-output agriculture, monocultures in forestry, locational choices in urban planning, etc. Intentional transformative change is strived after via a variety of BPI instruments and strategies, ranging from public commitment to the Montreal Kunming Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which has biodiversity mainstreaming as an explicit focus, to concrete interventions such as ‘no net loss of biodiversity’ regulations, financial incentive schemes such as payments for ecosystem services and green procurement, and communicative instruments such as eco-labels. Insight into enablers of and barriers to BPI in terms of outputs, outcomes, and impacts is still in its infancy. Recent work takes a layered approach to analysing enablers and barriers, distinguishing between enablers and barriers that are observable in concrete BPI cases (e.g., a lack of resources or collaboration) and more structural factors (in particular, the institutional setting, including the absence or presence of mechanisms to hold specific actor(s) accountable for biodiversity action; a culture of collaboration between public and private actors within a policy sector; the regular evaluation and reconsideration of policies; and, more generally, the flexibility or rigidity (‘lock-in’) of institutions)(Runhaar et al., 2023, forthcoming).

40,12/03/2024 22:14:39,csarcamilo@gmail.com,Camilo Castillo (Colombia),Department of Global Studies Gothenburg University,Sociotechnical infraestructures,"Sociotechnical infrastructures are the emergent systems that organize people and technologies such as databases, information systems, maps, metrics, instruments and more to enable a wide range of actors to know and act in specific ways regarding all kind of contemporary matters including biodiversity loss (Blok et al., 2016). This theory comes from the pioneering work of Susan Leigh Star (1999), who extensively studied the interrelated influence of technological systems and people (thereby the adjective “sociotechnical”) in helping to stabilize particular orderings that can be open to transformation and change. In this way, the approach takes infrastructures as much more than roads, railroads, bridges and so on. Or as Brian Larkin (2013) has argued, sociotechnical infrastructures are the objects that create the grounds on which other objects operate, so they are things and also the relation between things. Sociotechnical infrastructures theories then, highlight the forms of politics and intervention shaped by these systems (Harvey et al., 2016), since they create in/exclusions that affect the ability of certain kinds of knowledge to count and certain kinds of actors to act in how transformative change occurs. This theory then contributes to understand transformative change by integrating the technical and social aspects involved in the ongoing material transformation of the world and its elements. As contemporary scholarship on sociotechnical infrastructures has pointed out, this concept has important implications to capture the ontological dimension of transformative change, since it helps to trace how multiple agents, including humans and non-humans meet, engage, transform and produce realities (Jensen & Morita, 2015).

","Within theories of sociotechnical infrastructures, transformative change can intentionally occur from diverse sites and circumstances where these systems shape both the way that critical challenges such as biodiversity can be intervened and the scope for transformative change that these systems can enable. Goldstein and Nost (2022) show that sociotechnical infrastructures organize the data that mediates socioenvironmental relationships. The effect of this, is that sociotechnical infrastructures create the practical arrangements that enable data to drive environmental governance and shape its transformative change processes. In that way, as Beaulieu (2022) argues, sociotechnical infrastructures contribute to assemble and maintain ways of knowing that solidify how problems related to sustainability and biodiversity loss are formulated, orient to possible solutions, and legitimize and support specific actors while excluding others in processes of transformative change. As other scholars have showed, transformative change within sociotechnical infrastructures occurs through the conjunction of human and non-human actors that can transform regional economies, people’s lives, make new forms of sociality, remake landscapes, define novel forms of politics and reconfigure subjects and objects all at once (Morita, 2016). This theory then, can allow new ways of navigating transformative change process since it pays attention not to actors per se (human or non-human), but to the sociotechnical infrastructures that their relations sustain to drive actions that can transform how we engage in practice with the causes of biodiversity loss. Recently, scholarship has stressed the role of sociotechnical infrastructures in composing the grounds for new affective and practical engagements between people and technologies to allow the emergence of alternative modes of repair that can be crucial for generating transformative change processes (Jiménez, 2014; Mora-Gámez et al., 2023). In summary, sociotechnical infrastructures are also material resources that can be intentionally designed and created to harness transformative change.","- Beaulieu, A. (2022).

(2023), is an integrative and empowering approach to scaling transformations to sustainability that emphasises the inter- and intra-connectedness of individual and collective actions within complex systems. A fractal approach focuses on generating patterns based on values that apply to all, such as equity and dignity. It acknowledges that addressing complex challenges like biodiversity loss and climate change requires aligning and leveraging agency across multiple levels and scales, from the micro to the macro. Fractal agency can be understood as both a quality and a capacity that allows individuals, regardless of their position, educational background, role, experience, or formal authority, to generate new patterns (Sharma, 2017). A fractal approach can be tailored to specific contexts, while still being strategically aligned to transform relationships and systems that are inequitable or unsustainable. Fractal agency proposes that thoughts, decisions and actions based on oneness can generate entangled patterns that replicate across scales (O'Brien, 2021). By recognising that values expressed through actions at all levels can have ripple effects throughout a system, fractal agency encourages the empowerment of diverse stakeholders to contribute to sustainability solutions while also ensuring accountability and responsibility.","O’Brien, K.

This approach shifts the focus from scaling through ""things"" (e.g., technologies, behaviours, projects) to scaling through a quality of agency based on universal values – i.e., values that apply to all, with no one excluded (Sharma 2017). Fractal approaches recognise that agency can influence different levels, from individual to collective and global scales, in a recursive manner – i.e. when the same principles and values are applied at different levels. It represents a quality of agency that generates self-similar, fractal-like patterns (O'Brien et al., 2023). Fractal agency is based on four fundamental steps. These steps are not sequential but must be implemented simultaneously to address the practical, political and personal spheres of transformation in an integrative manner. Step 1: Recognise the universal values that are important and identify which principles to follow. Step 2: Identify how the current problems manifest in practice and decide what visible changes and measurable results are desired.

Transformative learning  (Mezirow, 2000) constitutes learning that affects your whole being and your being in the world. Sometimes it is referred to as ‘deep learning’ and learning that impacts one’s inner development as it affects one’s values, convictions, assumptions, frames and ways of viewing oneself (identity) and the world of which one is a part (O’ Sullivan, 1999). Often a disruption or discontinuity in one’s thinking is needed to create space for a new way of thinking. Transformative learning can be triggered by being exposed to alternative perspectives, dissonance, discomfort and disorienting dilemma’s. Some scholar connect transformative learning with transgressive learning to emphasize that fundamental change requires going against the grain, questioning the normal and learning from the resulting resistance (Kulundu et al. 2020). Interaction with others through forms of dialogue and debate, as well as self-reflection are critical aspects of transformative learning (Lysaker and Furuness, 2011). Typically, transformative learning implies transformation at the individual level, it does not necessarily imply societal transformation. However, within transition movements involving a wide range of people, groups and networks, transformative learning is often viewed as an essential component of learning for and in transitions as such transitions do require a deep commitment and alignment of underlying shared values and principles (van Mierlo et al, 2020).

Since transformative learning affects the inner being in relation to the outer world, transformative learning can be viewed as a prerequisite in larger societal transitions that require a fundamental shift in thinking and acting (Woiwode et al., 2021). Within socio-ecological change towards sustainability, transformative learning is viewed as a lever for becoming an intentional, relational and agentic human being that is guided by an ethic of care and affective solidarity, a sense of justice and responsibility and by both the willingness and capability to act in accordance to one’s values (Souza et al, 2019). In environmental management, water resource management, forestry and biodiversity conservation, transformative learning often connects with social learning (Borie et al, 2020). When transformative learning converges with social learning and the development of transformative capacities and reflexivity in socio-ecological systems that include multiple stakeholders at different levels, it can become a catalyst for strengthening wider social movements and transitions towards sustainability. Scoones at al. (2020) provide some examples of transformative learning as an integral component of structural, systemic and enabling approaches to sustainability transformations in sustainable seed systems, wetland conservation and peri-urban development.

Some scholars point at the need for alignment between taking on a transformative learning perspective and the kind of research that is done. Often community-based participatory research, research as co-design but also research as activism, are mentioned as methodological approaches that are congruent with transformative learning and capacity building that seeks to engage multiple people with different ontological and epistemological vantage points in transitioning towards a world that is more sustainable then the one currently in prospect (Lotz-Sisitka et al., 2016).

44,20/03/2024 18:51:01,aboni@ingenio.upv.es,Alejandra Boni,Ingenio (CSIC-Universitat Politécnica de Valéncia),Transformative Innovation Policy,"In recent decades, policymakers and researchers have focused on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) as key drivers for economic growth, innovation, and job creation. Transformative Innovation Policy (TIP), also known as the third frame for innovation policy, emerged in the early twenty-first century, responding to the pressing environmental and social challenges, aiming at long-term transformation (Schot et al, 2018). TIP builds on previous innovation policy frames (Research and Innovation, and Systems Innovation), acknowledging their role in building knowledge, upgrading technology, and enhancing productive capacity, but recognising their limitations on giving a clear directionality (towards just sustainable development) and recognising upfront and ex-ante unintended consequences of innovation (Schot and Steinmueller, 2018).
To craft a policy that effectively addresses social and environmental needs and brings about transformation on both national and regional scales, the STI policy must shift focus and adopt new characteristics. Drawing from the sustainability transitions literature (Gren et al, 2018), TIP prioritises the transformation of socio-technical systems, incorporating concepts like experimental delivery, directional focus, and inclusivity. Every economy relies on numerous socio-technical systems that serve critical societal functions such as the provision of energy, food, healthcare, mobility, and communication. TIP seeks to redirect these systems towards greater sustainability.
Furthermore, TIP began to broaden its understanding of innovation including civil society and citizens as not only consumers and adopters of innovation but as promotors and sources for innovations that address social and environmental needs. It advocates for bottom-up open innovation spaces where radical alternatives to the dominant unsustainable and unfair practices evolve, involving more actors in this space and engaging them in a participatory way. This should lead to carving out directionality portfolios and sustainable pathways for moving forward (Weber and Rohracher, 2012). This is not an easy and consensus-driven process but a political one (Stirling, 2015).

","Socio-technical transitions drive intentional change across various systems to achieve desired environmental and social outcomes, necessitating a nuanced understanding of complexity. This involves adopting transdisciplinary approaches, integrating knowledge and methodologies from diverse academic and non-academic sources to tackle intricate issues through experimentation. Gosh et al. (2021: 740) advocate for experimental engagements to propel transformative change, initially focused on policy but expandable to business, investment, societal groups, and academia. These engagements encompass a range of activities, including initiating, supporting, or mobilizing experiments, evaluating their impact, and facilitating social learning to develop alternative pathways towards desirable futures. Such endeavours are time-limited and characterized by reflexivity and learning, involving a coalition of actors collaborating to address common challenges (Molas-Gallart et al., 2021).
Socio-technical systems are constructed and maintained by actors who are guided by a set of dominant formal and informal rules, which together form a regime. These systems change when shifts occur at different levels, as theorised by the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2002; Geels and Schot, 2007). Specifically, it occurs when dynamic and complex interactions emerge between actors advancing new solutions and ideas in niches, deviating, and destabilising dominant practices. Niches are protective spaces where different ideas, models, configurations, and ways of doing are tested and developed. Although regimes seek to remain stable, they get also pressured by long-term exogenous trends and shocks, or landscape, breaking the dominant configuration of the system and giving space to the niches to replace the dominant regime. Significantly, the MLP provides analytic lenses to determine systems transitions when three conditions are met: 1) a regime is destabilised, 2) niches provide strong alternatives at scale, and 3) landscape trends and shocks are perceived by the regime and niche actors as a window of opportunity for a transition.

45,27/03/2024 12:00:27,francisco.alpizar@wur.nl,Francisco Alpizar (Costa Rica),Wageningen University and Research,Behavioral Economics,"The standard neoclassical economics approach assumes a representative agent that is a selfish, perfectly informed, and a rational utility maximizer with stable preferences and a long-term perspective. The empirical evidence shows though that human choices are more complex than this (Kahneman, 2003). BE involves three groups of deviations from the standard rational choice model: bounded rationality, bounded willpower, and bounded self-interest. Bounded rationality implies that human problem-solving is constrained by limited cognitive abilities (Simon, 1955). There are four main implications of this. First, many human decisions are determined by how information is presented to us more than by the consequences of our decisions (a so-called ""framing effect""). Second, individuals are more likely to take action to avoid a loss than to pursue a gain, leading to inaction and lost opportunities (so-called ""loss aversion""). Third, our judgment of a particular situation is heavily influenced by what first comes to mind rather than by a careful assessment of information, resulting in poor choices (so-called ""availability bias""). Finally, many of our choices are not a choice but automatic responses that do not resort to our analytical capacity and could hence be damaging to the planet and even ourselves. Bounded willpower refers to humans frequently failing to follow up on their commitments or failing to take commitments altogether. Humans fail to see the consequences of their actions (myopia of intertemporal choices). Another feature of bounded willpower is called cognitive dissonance, i.e., a mismatch between what people want and the things they do. Procrastination regarding reducing your impact on the environment is a prime example. The third behavioral deviation is bounded self-interest. Evidence shows that individuals perceive themselves as herd animals, frequently willing to sacrifice themselves to help others, or capable of punishing those that act against the benefit of the group. Evidence shows that individuals have pro-social or others-regarding preferences. This is a potentially positive feature of social comparisons, but it can also be dangerous in those cases were herd behavior leads to large environmental or social damages. ","Kahneman, D. (2003).

","The power of BE is in informing and developing better environmental and resource management models and policies (Shogren and Taylor 2008 and Brown and Hagen 2010). We need to switch to more realistic human behavior assumptions of individual and collective behaviors to produce truly transformational changes, instead of short term patches. Traditional market-based policy instruments and command and control measures need to be complemented and sometimes upgraded to account for the behavioral reactions of individuals and firms. To achieve that, the contribution of BE to policy design can be structured in three sets of tools: (i) tools that change the choice architecture, (ii) tools focused on peer comparison or social norms, and (iii) improved analytics. 
Choice architecture refers to how policies are presented and how those influences decisions (Thaler and Sunstein 2008). Simplifying the way information is presented, changing the default alternative, and making efficient decisions a matter of habit (e.g., introducing efficient light bulbs) are helpful examples. Social norms and peer comparisons to change people's pro-environmental behavior is also essential (Abrahamse and Steg, 2013). This tools has been been extensively used in context of water and energy use, green options, tourism, and recycling (e.g. Byerly, 2018). Moreover, policymakers must know agents' responses to past or current policies. Frequently policies are designed under the presumption that agents will remain inert to the policy itself. But a critical analytical insight is that individuals always react to policies and rules by ignoring them, hating them, using them in their favor or against someone, interpreting them, and, now and then, obeying them.

46,21/03/2024 21:38:46,csarcamilo@hotmail.com,Camilo Castillo (Colombia),School of Global Studies - University of Gothenburg,Actor Network Theory (ANT),"Actor-networks are the web of associations that constitute entities and relations between human and nonhuman elements such as bodies, groups, ecologies, that mantaim them together with the capacity to act (Farias et al., 2020). The concept of association is crucial for actor-network theory (ANT), since it indicates the capacity of actors to link between each other and form networks (Sismondo, 2010). In that way, associations are a type of connection able to maintain together and create new relations between elements as diverse as humans, microbes, regulations, animals, viruses, and more (Latour, 2005). This theory is characterized by its sensibility towards relationality, heterogeneity, and materiality. Regarding relationality, ANT argues that no entity exists outside a web of relations, so it is a network and its internal relations that shape different entities within it and the network itself (Law, 2008). About heterogeneity, ANT states the importance of symmetry, it is, the assumption that in principle human and nonhumans could have the capacity to become actors once they are associated within a network (Latour, 2005). In its material sensibility, ANT emphasizes the need to attend to materials, devices, artefacts and other objects that shape the social world and its networks (Farias et al., 2020). This means that we could not understand actor-networks without the materials and components that allow networks to sustain action. Given its anti-essentialism and non-foundational style, ANT is a robust theory to understand how transformative change occurs, since this approach is concerned with the material associations through which different kind of actors are brought together to work together and change the ways in which they act (Callon & Law, 1995). For this reason, ANT can be a toolkit able to follow the often-overseen chains of associations that produce transformative change, which could take us to surprising places such as mountains, laboratories, scientific texts, social movement meetings, satellites and more.","- Callon, M., & Law, J.

","ANT explores the contingencies of power, generating tools to undo the inevitability of that power while working on the possibility that other and better worlds are possible (Law & Singleton, 2013). This brings interesting possibilities for studying how intentional transformative change occurs. For example, in the field of politics and policy, ANT argues that policy is an scenario where nature and the social are negotiated and handled together to create the potential for transformative change (Law & Singleton, 2014). In this way, for ANT transformative change is not to be analyzed by following individual actors that are assumed to have the intrinsic agency to generate transformative change. Instead, ANT focuses on the practical and material processes of construction through which collective life is organized. So, transformative change is to be studied as a collective achievement organized through networks that constitute and distribute agency capacities among humans and nonhumans (Farias & Bender, 2010). Here, transformative change occurs as an effect of the associations capable of generating processes of transformative change within a network. They can be analyzed by following the series of movements that activate relations between heterogeneous elements (human and nonhuman), that allows us to see how these associations mobilize a world and enable courses of action that produce transformative change. That is why the potential of ANT for addressing biodiversity loss and its implications for generating and navigating transformative change processes lies in its sensitivity to follow associations. According to Latour (2004), this relational and associative understanding of transformative change could help us to redefine politics and transformative change as the progressive composition of a good common world. Therefore, ANT can be better understood as a sensibility of working in the world to create analytical contexts, but also on the world to articulate and press particular transformative changes and their politics (Law & Singleton, 2013).","- Farias, I., & Bender, T.

Conceptualisations of regenerative discourse and praxis vary. A common theme is the need to move beyond sustainability, recognizing ecological damage, and designing to produce mutual benefits across socio-technical and ecological systems (Mang and Reed, 2012, p3). Building regenerative capacities are important, i.e. the ability of complex, interconnected, whole living systems to renew themselves. Humans participate as nature, not controlling it (Tillman Lyle, 1984; Reed, 2007; Wahl, 2016). Spirituality is infused in relations of interbeing and interdependence (Wahl, 2016). Examples: permaculture - an ecological design system integrating human habitats and food production based on Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge (Mang and Reed, 2020), biophilic design, biomimicry and living buildings (Hes and Du Plessis, 2014). In agriculture, holistic land management frameworks (Allan Savory) and ongoing organic restoration of complex living systems based upon healthy soils (Robert Rodale) are important (Mang and Reed, 2020). Definitions include processes (e.g. reducing tillage) and/or outcomes (e.g. improved soil health, increased biodiversity) (Newton et al, 2020). In food systems, regenerative agriculture is a discursive alternative to industrial-productivist systems (Gordon et al, 2022). Agricultural work sits in nested, living systems, with the overall system having capacities to self-renew via continual learning, and departures from industrial approaches to varying extents (Gordon et al ibid), including wholesale shifts to food commoning (Duncan et al, 2020). In landscape design, regenerative principles and values are integrated into development and design frameworks and technologies (Gibbons et al. 2018). Regenerative cities create mutually enhancing relations with any natural systems that sustain them (Giradet, 2010). Regenerative businesses generate value for all stakeholders, while enhancing socio-ecological wellbeing and human potential (Sandford, 2017). Regenerative economy concepts propose a regenerative form of capitalism (Fullerton, 2015), operating within Earth boundaries (Raworth, 2017) and requiring business, governmental and civic cooperation for natural and social capital regeneration (Lovins (2019).

","Change in regenerative approaches is intentional, involving active participatory design processes (Manzini, 2015) for co-creation with nature, appropriate human participation as nature, and ecological principles e.g. biomimicry, nutrient cycling, soil care (Reed, 2009; Wahl, 2016). Specific pathways for change include design practice, education, community living (Wahl, 2016). Change is achieved through leverage in systems, facilitated by designs with the wider socio-ecological system in mind, creating conditions for self-renewal, adaptiveness, and healthy flourishing of all life through regenerative cultures (Wahl, 2016). Regenerative capacities are strengthened across built, cultural and natural environments (Mang and Reed, 2020). 

Regenerative design solutions refer specifically to systems of technologies and strategies, generated from place particularities, and understandings of whole living systems to manifest their inherent capacity for vitality and evolution (Mang and Reed, 2020. Regenerative development is broader, providing whole understandings of place and stakeholder capability strengthening for maximum systemic leverage so living beings can co-evolve and planetary self-expression in diversity, complexity and creativity (Mang and Reed, 2022). Regenerative development manifests potentials for health, wellbeing and happiness of all system members, shifts in worldviews, deep inhabitant and practitioner engagement in collaborative processes, attention to supportive infrastructures for mutualistic relations between dynamic system components, value addition across scales, and individual and local efforts coordinated within larger scale, regional initiatives to grow wider system regenerative capacity (Gibbons et al, 2018). 

Partnership with place (moving from a notion of control to one of cultivation and collaboration) and progressive harmonisation (continual improvement of harmony between human and natural systems) can achieve change (Mang and Reed, 2020). Regenerative discourses may support change through bringing together relevant coalitions which share goals and principles, plus translocal organising and collective learning, but tensions exist between discourses and there are opportunities for greenwashing and co-optation (Gordon, Davila and Reidy, 2023).

48,26/03/2024 12:26:59,P.J.Newell@sussex.ac.uk,Peter Newell (United Kingdom),University of Sussex,International political economy,"Political economy approaches to transformative change seek to understand both the actors, interests and institutions which benefit from the status quo that might be resistant to change, as well openings for moving beyond it. Political economy is an umbrella term for a diversity of approaches which have in common the fact that they place questions of power and politics centrally in their analysis, moving beyond the narrower study of socio-technical transitions which describe narrower changes in the provision of key services around mobility, heating and cooling, food or potentially biodiversity conservation (Newell 2021). 
Transformative change in political economy accounts looks to address the causes and drivers of the problem rather than how its symptoms are treated through governance reform or technological and market innovation. Applied to biodiversity and ecosystem services, the focus might be on the concentrated power of agri-food corporations and the impacts this has on land use and deforestation (Clapp and Fuchs 2009), on the key drivers of production and consumption which are driving biodiversity loss which might be thought to lie in economic incentive structures, inequitable property rights and the lack of value given to people and environments: what some authors have called ‘cheap nature’ and ‘cheap labour’ (Patel and Moore 2018). They are also attentive to longer-term historical processes of transformation which they look to for parallels and inspiration about what might be possible going forward (Newell and Simms 2021; Perez 2002).

Though traditionally focused on economic structures and the relationship between states and markets (Strange 1988), more recent political economy thinking has been brought to bear on debates in systems thinking about leverage, intervention and tipping points and promoted the idea of ecosystems of transformation to recognise both the plurality of approaches to generating change from individual to system change (Newell et al 2023), as well as the interrelated nature of transformation processes led by states, markets, technology and citizens (Scoones et al 2015). This is helpful in creating ripple and multiplier effects where, for example, shifts in finance can trigger change in corporate behaviour and allow states to raise their level of ambition around biodiversity and ecosystem protection.

","Key actors in political economy accounts of transformative change are states, corporate actors (often referred to more generically as capital), regional and global institutions and social movements. Drivers of change, therefore, include social pressure and civil society activism challenging state authority and corporate practice and surfacing new social norms around biodiversity conservation and use (Scoones et al 2015); technological revolutions often brought about large scale shifts in finance (as occurred at the time of the industrial revolution, under Fordism and in relation to the IT revolution) (Perez 2002) and which are required now around food production, and state led visions and plans to restructure economies as some governments are attempting to do with Green New Deals and the Inflation Reduction Act. Regional and international institutional institutions can either support more transformative change by mobilising finance and building capacity or lock in unsustainable pathways through using aid and development finance to support projects and investments that accelerate biodiversity loss as has happened so often in the place through large infrastructural projects and promoting the export of monoculture agriculture and forestry products, for example.  

Since the drivers of biodiversity loss are numerous and interconnected, political economy accounts would highlight the need to use a range of tools and approaches to trigger change within an ecosystem of transformation made up of states with uneven power and capacity, businesses of different sizes and civil societies faced with closing civic space in many parts of the world. No one approach will work in all contexts, but getting to the drivers of the problem will mean following and redirecting public and private finance, efforts to reduce consumption in richer parts of the world through dietary change and other means, addressing huge inequities in land distribution and access which concentrate power over our collective future in the hands of actors most resistant to transformative change and whose overrepresentation in political decision-making needs to be challenged as part of a broader shift in power.

49,,christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,Christine Wamsler,"Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS), Sweden",Inner Transformation,"Inner transformation for sustainability is an emergent field of research, education and practice. 1 The
aim is to support integrative approaches that link inner and outer dimensions of transformation
across sectors and levels to, consequently, enhance individual, collective and planetary wellbeing,
regeneration and flourishing. 1,2 Inner dimensions are defined as individual and collective mindsets,
beliefs, values, worldviews and associated inner capacities/qualities (cognitive, emotional, relational).
The concept recognises that inner and outer dimensions are never separate, but are co-created. 1,2 On
this basis, inner transformation involves changes in the sphere of human inner dimensions and refers
to all kinds of actions at individual, collective and system levels that support integrative changes in
views, structures and practices, which address the impacts, drivers and causes of today’s polycrisis,
including biodiversity loss. 1,2
The field of inner transformation addresses unsustainable narratives and paradigms of separation
(alienation from self, others, nature) that underlie today’s polycrisis. They are an integral element of
modern life forms, and they are reflected in modern societies’ culture, the institutional and political
landscape, and associated power structures. 1-5 Inner transformation is thus about enabling intra- and
inter-generational, human- and non-human relationships, and ways of connecting to self, others and
the world in ways that support integrative action-taking across sectors and scales. 1 Related research,
practice and education recognise: i) the interdependence of inner and outer phenomena across
individual, collective and system levels (and associated views, practices and structures); ii) the
potential that is latent within every human to enable transformative change; iii) the need to address
inner dimensions across all levels; iv) the possibility to generate inner, transformative
capacities/qualities through intentional practices; and v) the need to include diverse perspectives and
expand associated knowledge systems (including indigenous and local) for sustainability. 1,2 Related
key theories and conceptualisations include the IMAGINE framework, integral theory, the three
spheres of transformation, the inner-outer transformation model, clusters of transformative
capacities/qualities, the mind-sustainability nexus, and the framework for contemplative scientific
inquiry, practice and education. 1,2,6-8",,"Inner transformation addresses deep leverage points and involves measures and methods that can
support more relational and regenerative views, practices and structures. 1-4 . Change is mobilised
through integrative measures that link inner and outer dimensions of transformation across sectors
and levels. 1,2 There are complementary ways to activate such integration, in order to, ultimately,
address mindsets, behaviour, culture and systems change in combination. 1,2,5,6
Measures at individual and collective levels include linking ‘outer’ approaches with activities that
help people tap into their inner potential, discover their internalised messages of separation,
superiority and instrumentalisation, develop alternative approaches, and create fields of change. 1,2,5
This can, for instance, be supported through appropriate working environments, communities of
practice, social movements, aesthetics, and transformative leadership and education. 2,6 The latter
involves holistic, contemplative, psychological, cognitive–behavioural and ethical learning
approaches (e.g., worldview journeys, mindfulness-, arts- and nature-based methods) that nurture
transformative capacities/qualities (e.g., self-reflection, intrinsic value orientation, compassion,
individual and collective agency). 2,5,6,9,10,11
Measures at system level aim to mainstream the consideration of inner dimensions into institutional
and political systems to foster more integrative approaches. 1,2 This institutionalisation entails

modifying organisations’ vision statements, policies, regulations, working structures, and tools for
project management, resource allocation, communication, monitoring and evaluation. 1,2,5,12
From an ethical standpoint, it is crucial to highlight that inner transformation is not about saying that
we need to fix other people’s views. This would turn them into objects to be changed, rather than
seeing them as agents of change. 1,2,12 Instead, it is about creating integrative measures, spaces and
conditions that nurture a culture of inner development, mutual support and engagement. Building on
a foundation of shared, universal values and interconnection, the aim is, ultimately, to rattle
unsustainable norms and systems. 1,2,13,14
Inner transformation is a dynamic field. It has attracted professionals from many disciplines and
domains, and is thus conceptualised using various terms (e.g., inner-outer transformation, inner
transition, existential resilience, existential sustainability). 1,2 Actors include governmental, UN,
private, non-profit and faith-based organisations, educational bodies, citizen groups, and local and
indigenous communities. 1-14","(1) Ives, C., Schäpke, N., Woiwode, C., Wamsler, C. (2023) IMAGINE sustainability: integrated inner-outer

50,,v.j.nelson@gre.ac.uk,Valerie Nelson (England) ,University of Greenwich ,Relationality,"Relationality is a broad field of diverse origins, including the thoughts of a Greek philosopher,
Heraclitus, who stated that ‘everything flows’, emphasizing the interconnectedness and
constant change or perpetual flux of the world. Other key thinkers include Heidegger,
Merleau-Ponty and North Whitehead (West et al, 2019). More than a specific theory,
relationality represents a path-breaking ontological turn across many fields of social sciences
and humanities. Conceptualisations vary. For some, relational thinking may be
complementary to sustainability sciences (West et al, 2019), for others the implications are
more far-reaching (Escobar, 2016). Walsh, Böhme, J. &amp; Wamsler, (2021, p80) find common
commitments to a ‘paradigm that (i) is grounded in a relational ontology, (ii) emphasizes the
need for understanding human and non-human nature as mutually constitutive, and (iii)
values more-than-human relations.’ A relational ontology challenges common assumptions
about what constitutes reality, seeking to overcome longstanding rigid dichotomies between
nature and culture, mind and matter, subject and object, which shape modern worldviews.
Diverse knowledge systems are not premised on such divides (Walsh, Böhme, J. &amp;
Wamsler, 2021), emphasizing the process nature of life i.e. that the ‘world exists in a
perpetual state of ‘becoming’, comprising continually unfolding relations (West et al, 2019). If
humans are ‘fundamentally in the material world’, rather than prioritizing interior mental
cognition (Wagenaar and Cook, 2011 cited by West et al, 2019, p311) by humans, diverse
aspects of experience, including embodied experiences, and the ‘capacity to affect and be
affected’ (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988) can be recognized, including by non-human agents.
Further, rather than reflecting the world, language and concepts in relationality, actively
shape it, with Indo-European languages evolving within substantialist paradigms which
reduce processes to static conditions (Elias 1978 cited by West et al, 2019).
Relational ontologies recognize continuities between actors and actants (Latour, 2005).
Such assemblages of the ‘more-than-human’ include human, and non-human (physical
forces and phenomena such as the wind or fire, material objects and things, living beings,
spiritual entities, technologies (Blaser, 2014; de Ls Bellacasa, 2017) all of which are
entangled (Barad, 2007) in complex networks (Latour, 2005). Relational philosophies include
many Indigenous and African cosmologies, Shintoism etc and are flourishing within
academic philosophy and in the space-time materialities of quantum physics. While entities
seem relatively stable to us (De Landa, 2006), they are ‘already constituted by movement’
(Ingold, 2011 cited by West et al, 2019, p310) in a departure from both modernist,
mechanistic perspectives and socio-ecological systems thinking (West et al, 2019). In other
words, any being, entity or body is conceived as ‘fundamentally constituted by relations of all
kinds’ (Walsh, Böhme, J. &amp; Wamsler, 2021, p80). In epistemologies or ‘how we come to
know the world’ (Walsh, Böhme, J. &amp; Wamsler, 2021, p75), as in quantum physics, the
observer shapes what it observes (Barad, 2007). Following Deleuze and Guattari (1988,
p127) on agency, defined not as ‘cognitive-reflective’ abilities alone, but the ’capacity to
affect and be affected’, agency is not solely about what humans do (Whatmore, 2002), but is
distributed within relational networks, assemblages and configurations (Latour, 2005 cited by
West et al, 2019). Transdisciplinary methods support the traversing of disciplinary
boundaries, with nature being produced in situated contexts (Haraway, 1988), i.e. knowledge
is always shaped by the specific social, cultural and historical contexts, with no objective,
universal, neutral perspectives from which knowledge can be produced (West et al, 2019).
Relational ethics move beyond anthropocentrism and the valuation of nature based on
instrumental values and explore how power inequalities and dynamics are infused within all

assemblages of interest, including human-nature interactions (Walsh, Böhme, J. &amp; Wamsler,
2021, p75) towards an ethics of care (e.g. de la Bellacasa, 2017).","Barad KM. 2007. Meeting the Universe halfway: quantum physics and the entanglement of

Guattari (1998), offer complex and dynamic understandings of how change happens. They
emphasize that change is non-linear, interconnected and rhizomatic (i.e. growing like a
rhizome or root-like structure in found in plants), occurring through lateral connections and
influences, as opposed to via hierarchical structures.
If relationality is a far-reaching shift in assumptions about what kinds of things do or can exist
in reality (Walsh, Böhme, &amp; Wamsler, 2021), then acceptance is itself a transformative act
(Stengers 2010; Clark 2014; Pellizzoni 2015 and Darnhofer, 2020 cited by West et al, 2019).
There are political implications from this shift, which implies a move towards ethics of care
(Puig de la Bellacasa, 2015). By recognizing that categories are not fixed, it is possible or
necessary to view them in more ethical ways (Darnhofer, 2020, cited by West et al, 2019).
Care then becomes things we do to sustain and regenerate our, bodies, selves,
environment, world (Tronto, 1993). Caring requires labour, but Puig de la Bellacasa (2015)
challenges conventional understandings of care as an altruistic, unidirectional act, and
emphasizes the situated and relational nature of care practices. Further, it is not only
humans that are involved in care, non-humans also participate in collective, embodied and

reciprocal practice (West et al, 2019). Additionally, the act of creating worlds, or worlding, is
a political task with ramifications for the role of researchers and the ethics of research (West
et al, 2019). Care distinguishes stewardship from management and governance approaches
in conservation and sustainability sciences (Enqvist et al. 2018).
Relationality provides fertile ground for richer analyses of human-nature relations, situated
empirical insights to shape decision-making and new approaches for sustainability that
cultivate and nurture relations in specific places and practice (West et al, 2019).","Deleuze G, Guattari F. 1988. A thousand plateaus: capitalism and Schizophrenia. London: Athlon

SHIFT is an acronym that stands for Social influence, Habit formation, Individual self, Feelings and cognition, and Tangibility as factors that contribute to behavior change. 
The framework can be seen as an extension of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985), one of the most fundamental theories in behavioral science. The five SHIFT factors exploit the frequently observed lack of connection between people's intentions and behavior. Social influence includes the influence of social norms and identity. Habit formation describes the factors that initiate long-term behavior change, not just momentary behavior change. Individual self describes factors such as self-efficacy and self-consistency, which are relevant for promoting motivation to change and ultimately bring about change. Feelings describe emotional factors that contribute to promoting change. And finally, tangibility refers to the importance of making the goals and outcomes immediate and proximal to the individual.

","To bring about transformative change based on individual behavioral change, change must be both deep and broad. Two factors in the SHIFT framework are particularly important to achieve depth and breadth: Habit formation and social influence. 
While some behaviors to prevent diversity loss are one-time, such as long-term investment decisions or decisions when constructing a building or garden, for instance, many individual behaviors are repeated and therefore require not just a one-time change, but a deep change in habits. While various interventions promote habit formation (e.g. facilitation, prompts and incentives), discontinuities and interruptions of old habits, e.g. a move or change of job, are beneficial for the introduction of new habits (Verplanken, 2011). The fresh start effect describes how even arbitrary, seemingly disruptive dates such as the first day of a new month or year can contribute to the development of new habits.
Social influence is particularly relevant to achieve broad change via a so-called social tipping point. Social tipping points describe dynamics in large-scale behavioral change that lead to a shift in social norms that further promote change (Young, 2015).

2. Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",Regenerative dialogues for sustainable futures,"Modern humans excel in practices of forecasting and foresight. However, this capacity does not necessarily result in transformative action. Projections and scenario building exercises no longer foresee business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission as an option (IPCC 2013), but society breaks emission records every year and climate-related disasters intensify. Science also projected in 2012 that places with high biodiversity, large human populations, poverty and environmental degradation where prone to epidemic or pandemic outbreaks of zoonotic diseases (Morse et al. 2012). Nevertheless, society did not act in anticipation to covid-19 pandemic. In other words, modern society forecasts, foresees, but does not often take anticipatory action. It is almost as if modern society does not feel the problems coming, or as if it senses that – at most – it is going to watch them happen on television or the internet. Until they happen. Since, anticipatory behaviour is about making decisions in the present based on assumptions about the future, it can be argued that the anticipatory system of modern society is impaired. Thus, it needs to regenerate. My argument is that modernity fractured the whole into modules. Sustainability, in its broadest sense of planetary wellbeing, will require that ongoing dialogues are expanded to include both non-modern worldviews (e.g., indigenous and local knowledge; postmodern views) and non-scientific forms of interpretation of reality (e.g., arts, philosophy, religions). This comprehensive and inclusive conversation can regenerate the fractures that have ruptured the connections between the “three ecologies” – of self, social, and environment – and reintegrate humans to the world, to nature as wholeness (Scarano 2024).","Main:

","‘Regeneration’ is a keyword behind intentional transformative change. It consists first in a change of mindset (from reductionism to holism), which is a pre-requisite to a paradigmatic socioecological change. Such change requires regeneration, in the sense of reparation of relationships (between beings), systems (connectivity and wholeness of spaces and times), and rights (visions, realities, utopias). Thus, a central tenet of the Scarano (2024) theory is that the intentional transformative change starts at the inner dimension, and then moves to a relational ground. Modernity reduced the whole into modules. Time (past/present/future), knowledge (scientific/artistic/ spiritual/local), worldviews (traditional/modern/postmodern), and ultimately the world (nature/culture/technology) are fractured. Some modules became hegemonic (e.g., modern science, innovation as technological only, and capitalism) and – despite historical improvements in many fronts – such hegemonies led the planet into its current state of multicrise, as climate change, biodiversity loss, and pervasive inequalities worsen. The hegemonic modern narrative became paradigmatic and desecrated nature, turning it into commodity. There is no possible ‘adaptation’ within this paradigm: transformative change is not about adapting, but about shifting paradigms. The transition from an unsustainable to a sustainable world requires imagining and believing in desirable futures distinct from the past-present, so as to take transformative action. Regenerative dialogues (between different worldviews, different forms of interpretation of reality, and between humans and more-than-humans) decolonise futures by enhancing imagination, building active hope and, ultimately, by promoting convergence of modules into wholes. The notion that a state of planetary wellbeing might emerge from regenerative dialogues implies the absence of a blueprint or roadmap for change. It is based on ‘open’ rather than ‘blueprint’ utopias. It circumvents the problem/solution dichotomy (another modern feature) and focuses on dialogues.

Ebba Brink ",Lund University,Everyday Resistance,"The term resistance is used to describe oppositional acts that can be organised and loud, such as protest or demonstrations, as well as more quiet forms, such as foot-dragging, feigned ignorance, or sabotage (Lilja et al., 2017; Vinthagen & Johansson, 2013). While political scientists interested in social change have shown the links between organised resistance and social transformations, less attention has been given to the more ordinary and quiet forms of resistance used by vulnerable groups that lack the time and possibilities to engage in social movements or revolutions (Scott, 1985). Thus, the term everyday resistance has been used to describe oppositional acts that “require little or no coordination or planning; they make use of implicit understandings and informal networks; they often represent a form of individual self help; they typically avoid any direct, symbolic confrontation with authority” (Scott, 1985, p. xvi). In Scott’s view, everyday forms of resistance are the ordinary means for marginalised groups to have a political voice (Scott, 1989). 
A resistance lens can help us to uncover bottom-up social needs and aspirations that can determine the possibilities for fair transformations (Falla et al., 2024). According to Bayat, resistance has a transformative power when vulnerable groups use it to make advances on the powerful to survive and improve their lives, what he calls “quiet encroachment of the ordinary” (Bayat, 2000). However, Falla in line with Scott argues that acts of resistance, even when they do not result in large social transformations, have an important value to assert the agency and freedom of marginalised groups (Falla et al., 2024; Vargas & Urinboyev, 2015).

They look into the quiet forms used by marginalised groups to make a living, assert their autonomy and oppose marginalisation and exclusionary policies without having to confront the authorities. While everyday forms of resistance may be combined with other more louds forms of opposition such as riots, protest and legal actions, what allows for long term transformation is the fact that actions are embedded in people’s everyday lives. Examples of acts of everyday resistance that address the causes of the biodiversity loss include, farmers in Tanzania complying only on the sides of the roads to a ban on local varieties that require more water than the adapted variety of crops (Naess, 21013), farmers in Kenya renting wells and lending land to nomadic groups in times of drought, despite a national ban (Eriksen & Lind, 2009), community members in São Tomé and Príncipe gossiping about an adaptation project that only benefits certain groups (Mikulewicz, 2019), and farmers in Burkina Faso ridiculed those who worked for projects that were not in accordance to the traditional way of life (Nielsen & Reenberg, 2010). Another relevant examples is the case of residents of the pacific islands resisting the narrative about “sinking islands” claiming a dignifying form of migration while blaming polluters countries (McNamara & Farbotko, 2017), and residents of an informal settlement in Cartagena planting mangroves to get protection from sea level rise and storms while fighting for the right to stay in areas declared as high risk (Vargas et al, upcoming).","Eriksen, S., & Lind, J.

54,,sanna.stalhammar@slu.se,Sana Stålhammar,,Relational values and Relationality,"Relational values as a values category has a recent history in the environmental values literature, and
was popularised with the publication by Chan et al. (2016) (also outlined in Muraca 2011; Jax 2013; Chan
et al. 2018). Based on a recent systematic review, Himes et al. (2024. p 7) propose the following
meaning of relational values: “values of meaningful, and often reciprocal human relationships—beyond
means to an end—with nature and among people through nature, where nature is often specified as a
particular landscape, place, species, forest, etc.”.
Relationality can be seen as an umbrella term for ways of understanding and studying human-nature
relations in a non-dichotomous way (West et al. 2020). This includes both by drawing on indigenous
knowledge systems (Ingold, 2006) and ideas from ideas within philosophy such as process philosophy
(Whitehead, 1978).
It is important to emphasise that even though the two are strongly associated, relational values and
relationality are different concepts. Relationality is broader and can be associated with different
knowledge systems or worldviews rather than understood as a values category (West et al. 2020). The
ways in which relational values are assessed methodologically does not automatically align with
relationality seen as a worldview, knowledge system or epistemological approach (Stålhammar &amp;
Thorén 2019). The concept of relational values can be operationalised and seen on a spectrum of
different interpretations of relationality, where some interpretations calls for a re-evaluation of how to
think about human-nature relations and a call to go beyond Cartesian dualisms and subject-object
dualisms (e.g. Muraca, 2011).","Chan KMA, et al. 2016. Opinion: Why protect nature? Rethinking values and the environment.

within this category, but that have not been described in this way in the literature. This refers to any
approach that deals with the intentional strengthening of noninstrumental place-based human-nature
relationships, where the focus is on the meaningful relation itself. There is a wide range of literature
dealing with e.g. community-based conservation and management initiatives, environmental education,
environmental psychology and nature connectedness, stewardship and governance, and the more-than-
human that would need to be systematically reviewed in order to give a better account of these implicit
uses of the idea of relational value as a “theory of change”. A few notable examples include:
Connectedness with nature has been extensively studied in environmental psychology and is known to
be a predictor for various forms of pro-environmental behaviour (Mackay et al. 2019). Zylstra et al.
(2014) suggest a conceptual framework that comprises: information about nature; experience in nature;
connectedness with nature; and committed connectedness with nature. “Committed” connectedness is
the behavioural dimension that integrates all three spheres of connectedness i.e. cognitive, affective
and experiential, and is described as the sustain embodiment of connectedness that serves social and
ecological communities through transformative leadership (Zylstra et al. 2014).
West et al (2018) weave together relational values and care to show how these approaches to
stewardship can lead to ethical sustainable pathways.

Transformative governance represents a recently developed approach. However, it builds on extensive scholarship from fields such as environmental governance and sustainability transformations. In the conceptualization of IPBES (2019) and Visseren-Hamakers et al. (2021), transformative governance combines the following four approaches to governance: 1. Integrative approaches focus on the relationships between sectors and policies and ensure policy coherence and effectiveness. 2. Inclusive approaches, including rights-based ones, reflect a plurality of values and thus promote equity. 3. Informed governance entails new strategies for knowledge production and coproduction that are inclusive of diverse values and knowledge systems. 4. Adaptive approaches—including learning, monitoring and feedback loops—help coping with inevitable uncertainties and complexities. The approach attempts to facilitate transformative change by the employment of such transformative governance approaches. It can also be conceptualized as an approach for governing transformative change, or for transforming governance in order to realize transformative change.","IPBES. 2019.

For example, studies have examined the processes in which large technological systems (LTS) become established, showing that many human factors play a large role in the promotion, shaping and adapting to systems such as electricity grids, road networks and the internet (Hughes 2000). Social construction of technology (SCOT) approaches studied how technological artifacts such as bikes are as much results of social processes and preferences as determined by fixed technological constraints and developments, while social construction of scientific knowledge (SSK) examined the social aspects of science (Bijker et al. 1987; Latour 1987). These theories point out that scientific and technological developments, which are often naturalized in retrospect, in fact could have developed differently depending on the social context and the human factors involved. An important contribution has been to oppose prevailing technological determinism, i.e. that technology alone drives societal developments (). The denaturalization of scientific and technological developments has further opened the way for studies of the politics of science and technology, since different possible developments will benefit or burden actors in different ways (Latour 2004).","Bijker, Wiebe E., Thomas P.

","The focus in these approaches are on the role of science and technology in societal transformations. However, scientific and technological developments are not understood as external processes that drives change in society, but as social processes co-driven by society (Hughes 2000; Latour 2004). Therefore, a variety of actors are involved in such developments: Those that develop, promote, use it and are affected in other ways. Since scientific and technological developments produce different winners and losers, a central tenet is that these processes should be politicized and democratized – that the built-in assumptions, contingencies and political implications are openly debated and that decisions with political implications are not taken exclusively by engineers or experts (Turnhout 2018, Stirling 2010). Recent studies have argued that current governance aiming to combat biodiversity loss and promote just transformative change would benefit from processes that politicize and democratize how scientific knowledge is employed in decision -making (Stokland et al. 2023).","Hughes, T. 2000.

57,,,Zuhre (chapter 3),,Environmental State and the Green State,"There is a plurality of approaches in environmental politics, including but not limited to liberal institutionalist accounts of environmental cooperation, international environmental regimes; and environmental governance. Theories of environmental state and the green state are one important set of approaches that gained considerable attention in recent years, emphasizing the role of the state in the politics of environmental protection. This came as a response to the approaches that prioritize non-state actors, mechanisms and networks in addressing environmental problems, with the aim to ‘bring the state back in’ as “the more traditional object of political inquiry” (Duit et.al, 2016: 2). Environmental state is defined as: “a state that possesses a significant set of institutions and practices dedicated to the management of the environment and societal–environmental interactions” (Duit et.al, 2016: 5). This conceptualization is largely based on empirical observation. On the other hand, theory of the green state is different in that it is a normative approach that aims to elaborate the “constitutional structures of a green democratic state that might be more amenable to protecting nature than the liberal democratic state” (Eckersley, 2004: 2-3).The environmental state is a viewed as a partial transformation (from the welfare state) of the ways in which state exercises its authority (Duit et. al. 2016). Recently, the term “glass ceiling of environmental transformation” (Hausknost 2020) have been introduced referring to the structural limits that the environmental state faces in fostering transformation.","Robyn Eckersley, (2004).

Intentional in the sense that science provides knowledge on cause-effect relations in environmental degradation, and depending on the nature of political coalitions, a change in the perspective of the state on how to tackle these problems with a transformative potential (Duit et.al 2016). Similar to the formation of the welfare state and its evolution to the environmental state because of state imperatives, because of the depth of environmental problems, evolution of the environmental state to a green state possibly bringing about socioecological transformation is envisaged. Intentional transformation requires rethinking the relationship between the state, political economy and democracy (Hausknost and Hammond 2020). For Green state theories, intentional trasnformative change comes with the potential of the state to facilitate and accelerate socio-ecological transformation, but can not fully plan it (Eckersley 2021). For the green state, critical conjunctures are crucial and “the practical task is to identify the next best transition steps with the greatest transformative potential.” (Eckersley, 2021: 256).","Robyn Eckersley (2021) Greening states and societies: from transitions to great transformations, Environmental Politics, 30:1-2, 245-265, DOI:10.1080/09644016.2020.1810890

58,,,Bjorn-Ola (chapter 3),,Structuration Theory,"Structuration theory, first outlined by sociologist Anthony Giddens, explains how social systems are created and reproduced through a synthesis of structure and agency without giving primacy to one of them. Instead, they are mutually constitutive – what Giddens terms the “duality of structure.” The structures are not stable. While they can restrict the possible action alternatives, they provide means and forms by which actors can take action and, consequently, possibly transform the structure itself.  

According to structuration theory, societies are made up of a collective of individuals whose interactions are structured by persistent patterns of rules and resources. These structures are upheld by institutions, norms, power relations, and cultural contexts that shape and constrain individuals’ actions. Conversely, through their actions actors reproduce but also potentially also challenge the structures. Giddens emphasizes the importance of reflexivity for structural change, that is the ability to reflect critically on one's actions in relation to societal structures.","Giddens, A.

Agency refers to the capacity to act with intent within present structures. Through their actions, individuals can both reproduce and challenge these structures. This creates a possibility of transforming societies in spite of deep-seated structures. Reflexivity – the critical reflection of how our actions interact with existing structures – provides some empowerment within the structural constraints whereby a transformative change is possible. The interplay between structures and agency, provides space for human agency to  challenge existing social structures, which enables that new forms of social organization and cultural practices emerges that ultimately leads to societal transformations.","Giddens, A.

Andrea Joslyn Nightingale ",,Feminist political ecology ,"Feminist political ecology is a diverse literature, grounded in feminist theories of power and inequality, that shows how social and environmental change emerge from histories of colonial capitalist exploitation and their on-going legacies (Mollett & Faria, 2018). It is distinguished from other socioenvironmental theories by its attention to how power operates in the everyday, through subjectivities and scales, creating social and geopolitical inequalities based on gender, race, class, caste, ability and other embodied differences (Mollett & Faria, 2018; Sultana, 2020). Power is not simply ‘power over’ but also ‘power to’ and ‘power for’. FPE shows how subjectivities shape uneven exposure to environmental hazards (Di Chiro, 2021; Gergan, 2020; Lyons, 2023), access to, distribution of and control over resources  and knowledge of environmental change (Harcourt & Nelson, 2015; Sultana, 2020). Feminist political ecology is most often grounded in performative and emergent ontologies, meaning that relations are never fixed, rather individuals are subjected in multiple ways that change over time, scale and space (Mollett & Faria, 2018). Research attention is thus placed on the conflicts, cooperation, spaces and temporalities through which societies and environments co-evolve. 

Some FPE theorists have shown how environments (or non-humans), entangle  with power to shape subjectivities , meaning that some people have, for example, greater affective relations with plants and other species (Durand & Sundberg, 2022), environmental destruction shows up in terrestrial and embodied forms (Gergan, 2020; Harcourt & Nelson, 2015; Lyons, 2023), and affective relations are vital to how people cooperate over their environments (González-Hidalgo, 2019; Nightingale, Gonda, & Eriksen, 2022). These insights have been combined with anti- and de-colonial approaches to environmental change which argue that it is not just humans that impact the environment, but rather that environments are also agents of change, reshaping subjectivities and understandings of environment , bringing species and human communities into particular relations with petrol capitalism (Lyons, 2023), hydropower (Gergan, 2020), climate change (Nightingale et al., 2022), and plants (Durand & Sundberg, 2022). These relations change the geopolitics of hydropower in South Asia (Gergan, 2020), botany knowledge production and conservation in Chiapas, Mexico (Durand & Sundberg, 2022), or how oil companies are held to account when territories are allowed to speak in courtrooms as the case of transitional justice in Colombia (Lyons, 2023). This kind of theoretical move is thus not simply about decentering humans as agents of change and transformation, but a more radical insistence on how human actions have affective consequences for people, other species and territories, wherein local actions spill over to affect wider territories and geopolitics (Di Chiro, 2021; Durand & Sundberg, 2022; Gergan, 2020; Harcourt & Nelson, 2015; Lyons, 2023; Mollett & Faria, 2018; Sultana, 2020).","González-Hidalgo, M. a.

The underlying ontological mechanisms differ from mainstream transformation debates, even if some principles appear similar. Transformation is not an end state, rather it is a radical reshaping of current social, political, economic-environmental relations through which change occurs (Di Chiro, 2021; Lyons, 2023). Di Chiro and the activist networks she is engaged with have argued for the importance of imagination to enact desired relations, exchanges and values in the present. This kind of environmental futuring rests upon a recognition of the histories of injustice and environmental harm that shape the future (Lyons, 2023), and our kinship with all of life, regardless of whether transformation occurs (Gergan, 2020). This kind of “…critical optimism is not passive, distanced, wishing for solar panels, carbon markets and biodegradable plastics to come to the rescue; it is an active, critical, and embodied form of hopefulness, it means seeing your own body, your own lifeworld in action” (emphasis in original) Di Chiro (2021 p. 822). FPE shows that it is not possible to promote ‘environmental subjectivities’ which remain stable, or which are always beneficial. Rather, coalitions for change come together and are successful for a period of time, but in the absence of renewal, tend to be co-opted by elites (Gergan, 2020), become dormant (Durand & Sundberg, 2022), or are subsumed by other coalitions intent on undermining their goals and more adept at moving across scales (Lyons, 2023). Affective relations show great potential for helping to create coalitions for change, at least in the short term. As Nightingale et al show (2022), it was a shared sense of grief and desires for the future of their children that allowed diverse people to work together for climate change adaptation. But these efforts are always transitory. Transformation in an FPE frame requires continual engagement, negotiation of complex relations of power and history, and a radical reimagination of how inclusions and exclusions are addressed by society.","Di Chiro, G.

","Emerging from their collective experiences from all over the world, Indigenous Peoples and local communities put forward six urgently needed transitions underpinning transformative change (These transitions are summarized through a problem tree illustrating the underlying drivers of the social-ecological crises and a solution tree illustrating contributions of Indigenous Peoples and local communities towards the renewal of nature and cultures (LBO-2 pp 247 and 290)):
1.	Cultural transitions towards diverse ways of knowing and being within a living, intelligent and sacred world;
2.	Land transitions towards securing customary land tenure contributing to human wellbeing and biodiversity and climate change solutions; 
3.	Governance transitions towards inclusive decision-making and self-determined development ensuring respect for human rights and diverse values of biodiversity;

It is fundamentally normative, asking questions about what should be, rather than what is, and co-creating solutions to achieve these values (Max-Neef, 2005). Transdisciplinary research requires researchers to reflect and deconstruct their own assumptions and ideas (Augsburg, 2014). Conducting transdisciplinary research often includes a period of time at the beginning of enquiries to build capacities, shared understandings and trust amongst participants (Horcea-Milcu et al., 2022). Following this phase 0, transdisciplinary research often entails stages of problem framing, analysis, and integration for impact to research and practice (Lang et al., 2012). These phases are not linear, and are iterative, requiring continued reflection and readjustment to emerging knowledge and understanding.

Transdisciplinary research contributes to understandings of transformative change in 4 main ways. Firstly, transdisciplinary research should transform the worldviews, mindsets and understandings of those who are participating in the process (see Augsburg, 2014). Secondly, transdisciplinary research is often enacted as a part of creating transformative change with communities. Thirdly, transdisciplinary research is increasingly the approach taken by researchers within sustainability science as part of exploring processes of transformative change. And fourthly, true transdisciplinary research requires broader transformations of knowledge systems (e.g. funding mechanisms, our framings of legitimate knowledge, etc.) to be effectively undertaken (Fazey et al., 2021). It thus challenges the dominant hegemony of quantitative, western knowledges for ‘evidence’-informed policy and action.

","Arguably, how change happens depends on what is being researched, where, and with whom. Common to many approaches is the shared, co-production of solutions, between research and non-researchers. In all explanations, there is emphasis on the process of transdisciplinarity as being the important factor in transformative change, and not just the outcome itself (Mitchell et al., 2015). Schneider et al., emphasise the role of transdisciplinary research in promoting knowledge for more informed and equitable decision making; fostering social learning for collective action; and enhancing competencies for reflexive leadership (Schneider et al., 2021).

Such processes are often (but not always) in place-based cases to solve specific problems (Pereira et al., 2021). Such formats reshape the relationship between science and society away from being linear (e.g. mode 1 science) and towards a dynamic dialogue (mode 2 science). There is also often an emphasis on individuals who navigate the process of co-construction and reflection according to their own particular approach (Chambers et al., 2022), to provide leadership and care (Caniglia et al., 2023). These individuals often act as systems entrepreneurs who help guide the construction of ideas, and enaction of practices to create tangible change. It requires significant buy-in and support from everyone engaged in the process. Often, the process involves shifts in power and surfacing tensions. For example, Chambers et al., highlight 4 pathways that transdisciplinary research can open opportunities for transformation: 1) elevating marginalized agendas; 2) questioning dominant agendas; 3) navigating conflicting agendas; and 4) exploring diverse agendas (Chambers et al., 2022). 

While co-creating transformations with communities, transdisciplinary research, and transdisciplinary researchers, are often pushing for broader structural changes. Such changes can include within their own universities or knowledge communities, as transdisciplinary researchers fight against funding systems and merit systems that reward more traditional science approaches.
